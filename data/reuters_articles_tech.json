Since November, Scania has sent members of staff to Northvolt's Ett plant in Skelleftea, 200 kilometres below the Arctic Circle, according to internal Northvolt documents reviewed by Reuters that outline Scania's support strategy for the green tech player. The plant employs some 2,500 people."

China's DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of U.S. models.

But it has certainly called into question the \"U.S. exceptionalism\" narrative that has helped create unprecedented concentration – and risk – in U.S. markets. The assumption that Silicon Valley is the unassailable leader in the global AI arms race is a key reason why U.S. markets have sucked in trillions of dollars from around the world in recent years. This trend has come to define U.S. exceptionalism, the deep-rooted belief in the continued outperformance of U.S. growth and Wall Street returns."

TikTok users are noting a difference in the short-video app following its revival after going dark on Saturday under a new law -- enacted over national security concerns during the Biden administration with bipartisan support -- that requires it to be sold to a U.S. buyer. Trump has vowed to find a solution to the ban, with several bidders in the mix, including people with close relationships to the new Republican president."

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in June ordered federal and Tamil Nadu state officials to probe Foxconn's hiring practices, after a Reuters investigation found the manufacturer excluded married women from iPhone assembly jobs at its southern India plant. Foxconn relaxed the ban during high-production periods, Reuters found."

Legal experts said despite Trump's order, service providers and app distributors such as Google (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and Apple (AAPL.O) , opens new tab still face major uncertainty and potential massive financial liability for defying a law that banned TikTok in the United States unless Chinese parent ByteDance divested the company by Jan. 19."

Tech executives' embrace of Trump, including billionaires such as Elon Musk in Trump's inner circle, has become a major theme of Trump's transition into power, and sparked warnings from former President Joe Biden."

Launched Friday night, Trump's so-called \"memecoin\" surged from less than $10 on Saturday morning to as high as $74.59 before giving up some of its gains on Monday. The token, branded $TRUMP and criticized by ethics experts , was last trading at $33.88, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko."

Regulators found that DCG and Genesis chief Soichoro Moro downplayed the impact of a mid-2022 default by one of its largest borrowers, Three Arrow Capital, the SEC said in a statement."

TikTok says its U.S. site generates billions for businesses selling candies, beauty products, clothes and other consumer goods. But now, that economy is under threat. The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the law banning TikTok in the United States on national security grounds ahead of a blackout this weekend."

While the U.S. ban has been debated for months, India acted swiftly in June 2020 to block TikTok and nearly 60 other Chinese apps over national security concerns, stripping many creators of their main source of income and shattering a digital community."

The justices heard arguments in an adult entertainment industry trade group's appeal of a lower court's decision allowing the Republican-led state's age-verification mandate. The lower court decided that the policy, intended to curb access by minors to online pornography, likely did not violate the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment safeguard against government abridgment of speech."

Standing 30 stories tall, the partially reusable New Glenn launcher sat on Blue Origin's launchpad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, ready for a liftoff that was initially scheduled for 1:00 am ET (0600 GMT) after being loaded with methane and liquid oxygen propellants."

        "text": "SHANGHAI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Lithium prices are expected to stabilise in 2025 after two years of steep declines as shuttered mines and robust electric vehicle sales in China soak up an oversupply, although the potential for mines to reopen may cap gains, analysts and traders said. A nearly 86% plunge in prices of the EV battery metal over the past two years from its peak in November 2022 forced companies to mothball mines across the world . But market participants say those closures mean buoyant demand should outpace supply this year as China intensifies policy support to boost sales in the world's largest EV market."

The order is set to land in the waning days of Biden’s presidency, during which several high-profile, Chinese-linked hacks occurred, according to the U.S. government and cybersecurity research groups. The alleged activity targeted critical infrastructure, government emails, major telecom firms and, most recently, the U.S. Treasury Department. Beijing has rejected the allegations."

Standing 30 stories tall, New Glenn has been a core focus for Blue Origin since the beginning of its decade-long development, representing a multibillion-dollar effort to sate demand for satellite constellation launches and snatch market share from SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9."

These diverging views raise the stakes for the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, as it prepares to decide the fate of a popular social media platform used by about half of Americans in a case testing the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech."

Taiwan has in recent years complained about what it sees as China's \"grey-zone harassment\" - from daily military drills and balloons near the island to cyberattacks - at a time when Beijing ramps up military and political pressure to force the democratically governed island to accept its sovereignty claim."

At issue were the implications such a move might have on whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and how the company would strike a balance between making a profit and generating social and public good as it develops AI."

It is the latest effort by Microsoft, which is a major backer of OpenAI, to lessen its dependence on the AI startup - a departure from recent years when Microsoft touted its early access to OpenAI's models. When Microsoft announced 365 Copilot in March 2023, a major selling point was that it used OpenAI's GPT-4 model."

The recommendations, which have not been previously reported, come as the U.S. electric-vehicle transition stalls and China’s heavily subsidized EV industry continues to surge, in part because of its superior battery supply chain. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to ease regulations on fossil-fuel cars and roll back what he called President Joe Biden ’s EV mandate."

Here's how the plan could work. A strategic reserve is a stock of a critical resource which can be released at times of crisis or supply disruptions. The best-known example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil, which was created by an act of Congress in 1975 after a 1973-74 Arab oil embargo throttled the U.S. economy. Presidents have tapped the stockpile to calm oil markets during war or when hurricanes hit oil infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico."

TikTok and ByteDance filed an emergency request to the justices for an injunction to halt the looming ban on the social media app used by about 170 million Americans while they appeal a lower court's ruling that upheld the law. A group of U.S. users of the app filed a similar request on Monday as well."
