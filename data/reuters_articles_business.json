President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday and would speak to him again later in the day. He is vowing to slap 25% tariffs on virtually all Canadian imports starting on Tuesday and a 10% surcharge on oil imports."

Beijing will challenge President Donald Trump's tariff at the World Trade Organization - a symbolic gesture - and take unspecified “countermeasures” in response to the levy, which takes effect on Tuesday, China's finance and commerce ministries said."

Trump on Saturday ordered 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% on goods from China starting on Tuesday to address a national emergency over fentanyl and illegal aliens entering the U.S., White House officials said.

As relations between the long-time allies who share the world's longest land border reach a new low, Trudeau told a news conference he was slapping tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of U.S. goods. Those on C$30 billion will take effect on Tuesday, the same day as Trump's tariffs, and duties on the remaining C$125 billion in 21 days, he said."

In September, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Lone Star, which owns 75% of Novo Banco, was considering a full sale as well as weighing an IPO. The sources said Novo Banco was worth about 5 billion euros ($5.2 billion)."

The European Central Bank cut rates on Thursday , the Bank of Canada did as well on Wednesday, and the Bank of England is likely to do so next week – steps that, with the Fed in a holding pattern on rates, could strengthen the value of the dollar and further complicate Trump's trade goals by making imports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive."

Goolsbee told CNBC, however, that \"there is a question mark that is coming from policy uncertainty,\" including over the impact of tariffs that President Donald Trump says he will impose on trading partners like Mexico and Canada as soon as Saturday. \"If it affects prices, it affects us ... our signal is getting a little muddied, when things are happening that drive up prices.\""

The January nonfarm payrolls report due next week will signal whether the labor market remains buoyant despite high borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, citing a strong economy and inflation still above its 2% target."

Mexico is the United States' largest trading partner, representing over 15% of total trade. The U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth of Mexican products in 2023, a figure that has grown about 70% over the last decade, census data showed. U.S. exports to Mexico also accounted for more than $322 billion."

Since November, Scania has sent members of staff to Northvolt's Ett plant in Skelleftea, 200 kilometres below the Arctic Circle, according to internal Northvolt documents reviewed by Reuters that outline Scania's support strategy for the green tech player. The plant employs some 2,500 people."

China's DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of U.S. models. Within days, it became the most downloaded app in Apple's App Store and stirred concerns about United States' lead in AI, sparking a rout that wiped around $1 trillion off U.S. technology stocks."

The pace of the declared crackdown on waste and corruption, which has already seen the first layoffs just weeks after rebels toppled Assad on Dec. 8, has triggered protests from government workers, including over fears of a sectarian jobs purge."

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, fell 5.5% last month to 74.2 from a downwardly revised 78.5 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would be unchanged in December following a 1.6% increase in November."

Large energy users have been investing in nuclear, geothermal and natural gas power plants to meet soaring demand for electricity from data centers. Energy storage, primarily large lithium-ion batteries, can help zero-emitting resources like wind and solar serve those needs by storing power when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing so that it can be used later."

They range from broad ones - a universal tariff on foreign-imported goods - to ones aimed at specific sectors, regions, or at specific countries in an effort to get others to meet his policy demands. However, Trump's threats have changed over time, ranging from small levies to ones exceeding 200%, leaving other nations and businesses unclear of what is to come next. Here is a roundup of Trump's trade-related threats."

Fed officials are almost certain to leave the U.S. central bank's benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range on Wednesday as they start weighing how the Trump administration's economic agenda may affect sticky inflation and solid growth trends."

The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted in December 2023 new rules aimed at reducing systemic risk in the $28 trillion Treasury market, the world's biggest bond market, by forcing more trades through clearing houses. The rules, which will give the agency greater visibility into the market, will be implemented in phases by June 2026."

The report from the Commerce Department on Monday also showed the rebound in home sales in November was much stronger than initially estimated. It added to data this month that showed single-family housing starts and building permits increased to a 10-month high in December, while sales of previously owned houses also rose to the highest level since February."

Oil is a popular inflation hedge because energy is a important component of Consumer Price Index (CPI) baskets and also feeds into them indirectly through goods and services costs. That means, however, that the large-scale adoption of such a strategy could itself help push consumer prices higher."

Ferguson, who has criticized social media companies for left-leaning content moderation policies, asked the commission on Thursday to grant him authority to strip all mention of DEI from FTC documents after President Donald Trump's executive order banning such programs in the federal government."

Bitcoin has been broadly steady since Trump took office on Monday, pushing the world's biggest cryptocurrency to a fresh record of $109,071. It was last trading around $106,000 on Friday as some of the euphoria around a hoped-for revolution in cryptocurrency regulation ebbed."

His predecessor Joe Biden, in one of his last acts as president on Friday, proposed curbing the \"loophole\". Trump indicated on his first day in office that de minimis was unlikely to survive in the U.S. for long, at least in its current state."

Senators Maggie Hassan, Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal cited on Wednesday the carriers' decision to ask for personal information before revealing seat fees, adding the airlines were apparently \"using customers' personal information to charge different seat fees to passengers on the same flight\" despite having the same fare. The senators said the carriers could be using consumers' ZIP codes, search history or other information \"to influence pricing.\""

The U.S. collects less than $100 billion annually in trade penalties imposed on imported goods as a tool to protect and grow domestic industries. That money is rarely a topic in Washington's routine budget battles because it makes up so little of the federal government's revenue."
