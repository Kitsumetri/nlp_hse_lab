The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday, which was conducted before the escalation in trade tensions, showed raw material inventories at factories were already declining last month, sending prices rising for the fourth straight month."

Nearly nine of every ten cargoes leaving the U.S. headed to Europe, while total exports to all countries for the month reached 8.46 million metric tonnes (MT). That is just shy of the monthly record of 8.6 MT hit in December 2023 and almost the same as the 8.5 MT sold in December 2024, according to LSEG data."

        "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street followed world stocks to a lower close on Monday amid fears that U.S. President Donald Trump 's tariffs on Canada , Mexico and China could ignite a global trade war, but U.S. equities reversed some losses after tariffs on Mexican imports were paused. All three major U.S. stock indexes veered sharply lower after the opening bell but partially recovered by the end of the session on news that tariffs on Mexican imports would be paused for a month after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to reinforce its border with the United States."

The S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Poland rose to 48.8 last month, from 48.2 in December, while the Czech PMI rose to 46.6, from 44.8 in December. Both have been below the 50 mark dividing expansion from contraction since mid-2022."

Trump's orders for additional levies of 25% on imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, as well as 10% on goods from China, were light on detail. But they kick in on Tuesday and have jolted markets as investors feared a broader trade war could severely hurt global growth."

As relations between the long-time allies who share the world's longest land border reach a new low, Trudeau told a news conference he was slapping tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of U.S. goods. Those on C$30 billion will take effect on Tuesday, the same day as Trump's tariffs, and duties on the remaining C$125 billion in 21 days, he said."

Havana Club International - a joint venture between state-owned Cuba Ron and France's Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) , opens new tab - says it exports rum to 125 countries. However, a U.S. Cold War-era trade embargo and related sanctions have long prohibited the import and sale of Cuban rum in the United States."

They were pricing in a second and final 2025 interest rate cut no sooner than October."

For many, that made signing up an easy decision - but getting out would be much harder. The Chinese workers hired by BYD contractor Jinjiang in Brazil had to hand over their passports to their new employer, let most of their wages be sent directly to China, and fork over an almost $900 deposit that they could only get back after six months' work, according to a labor contract seen by Reuters."

The European Central Bank cut rates on Thursday , the Bank of Canada did as well on Wednesday, and the Bank of England is likely to do so next week – steps that, with the Fed in a holding pattern on rates, could strengthen the value of the dollar and further complicate Trump's trade goals by making imports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive."

But there are multiple problems here, not least Europe's likely unwillingness to play ball. For any repeat of the dramatic 1985 \"Plaza Accord\" between the U.S. and its main allies to weaken a then-stratospheric dollar exchange rate and ease America's widening deficits, the clue is probably in the name: \"Accord\"."

Electric vehicle sales in Thailand, Southeast Asia's largest EV market, are forecast to jump 40% this year, exceeding 100,000 units and reversing a 8% drop in sales last year, Suroj Sangsnit, president of Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand (EVAT), told Reuters."

China's DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of U.S. models. Within days, it became the most downloaded app in Apple's App Store and stirred concerns about United States' lead in AI, sparking a rout that wiped around $1 trillion off U.S. technology stocks."

Headline inflation declined more than expected to 1.6% last month.

The U.S. producer price index for final demand was unchanged in September, slightly below the forecast of economists polled by Reuters for a gain of 0.1%. It followed an unrevised 0.2% increase in August, indicating inflation continues to cool and giving the Fed leeway to continue cutting interest rates."

        "text": "BRASILIA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Soccer-mad Brazilians have fallen hard for online sports betting , yielding a boom of interest from foreign gambling companies that may boost state coffers but also threatens to divert funds from consumer spending in other areas. Latin America's largest economy has seen lower-than-expected growth in consumer spending in the country in recent months, a weakness some banks and think tanks are blaming on gambling. Such a linkage would echo data seen in some U.S. states touched by online gambling fever."

Inflation slowed to 3.5% in July but was still above the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2%-3% target range. Along with a strong job market, that leaves little to no room for policymakers to cut rates next week."

        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - One of the most consequential Federal Reserve meetings in recent history has put investors’ focus squarely on one question: whether the central bank has kicked off its rate cutting cycle in time to keep the economy from slowing too rapidly. The Fed delivered a 50 basis point rate cut on Wednesday - lowering borrowing costs for the first time in more than four years - and assured investors the jumbo-sized reduction was a measure to safeguard a resilient economy, rather than an emergency response to recent weakness in the labor market. Bets on the size of the rate cut swung in the days before the meeting and were near an even split on Wednesday morning."

Only 47% of U.S. firms were optimistic about their five-year China business outlook, a drop of five percentage points from last year, according to the survey published on Thursday by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\nThis was the weakest level of optimism reported since the AmCham Shanghai Annual China Business Report was introduced in 1999. Also at record lows were the number of firms profitable in 2023, at 66%."

Known as LFTs, the bonds tied to the country's benchmark interest rate, Selic, typically reduce predictability in debt management. The government is trying to use fewer LFTs long-term but these bonds are more sought by investors during periods of risk aversion, which occurred this year due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. monetary policy, the Treasury noted."

Powell, in remarks on Friday at the annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said \"the time has come\" to cut interest rates as rising risks to the job market left no room for further weakness and inflation was in reach of the Fed's 2% target, offering an explicit endorsement of an imminent policy easing."

        "text": "WELLINGTON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank slashed its benchmark rate for the first time since March 2020 and flagged more cuts over coming months, saying inflation was nearing its 1% to 3% target in a sharp dovish tilt that sparked a sell-off in the kiwi dollar. The decision to reduce rates by 25 basis points to 5.25% came almost a year ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) own projections, taking some market players by surprise and prompting bets of an aggressive easing path through to the end of 2025."

Haniyeh's death came less than 24 hours after the most senior military commander of Lebanon-based Hezbollah was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut. The killings fuelled concern that the 10-month-old war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas was turning into a wider Middle East conflict."
