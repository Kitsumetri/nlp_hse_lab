Since Trump ended former President Joe Biden's legal entry program at the border and is ramping up border security , Diaz is considering using smugglers who would bring him deeper into the United States, along isolated pathways."

New Delhi and Beijing reached a milestone pact in October on lowering military tensions on their Himalayan border and have begun taking baby steps to restore ties following talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Russia."

The agreement also includes a U.S. commitment to prevent trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on X. The two leaders spoke by phone on Monday, just hours before U.S. tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada were set to take effect - steep levies that economists say would cause widespread economic harm, including raising prices for U.S. businesses and consumers."

After taking office, Trump ordered military and immigration officials to be ready by Feb. 3 to implement the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, last used to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two. The move - which would almost certainly face legal challenges - could allow him to bypass due process rights and rapidly remove migrants."

Staunching that flow was a primary motivation cited by Trump in imposing sweeping import taxes on goods on the three largest U.S. trading partners. Absent a fully global end to the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption, it is not clear how effective Trump's approach will be at curbing the flow of fentanyl."

As relations between the long-time allies who share the world's longest land border reach a new low, Trudeau told a news conference he was slapping tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of U.S. goods. Those on C$30 billion will take effect on Tuesday, the same day as Trump's tariffs, and duties on the remaining C$125 billion in 21 days, he said."

        "text": "BRASÍLIA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is bracing for another two years of struggle with the nation’s Congress, as lawmakers convene on Saturday to potentially elect leaders to both the House and Senate who have promised to continue exerting tight control of an overstretched federal budget. Legislators are expected to elect Hugo Motta as speaker of the House and Davi Alcolumbre for the Senate presidency. The two lawmakers have gained support from conservatives and liberals alike partly by promising to fight for Congress to determine how to spend an ever-bigger share of Brazil’s federal budget, with little regard for the Lula administration’s policy priorities."

Although it could still trigger a no-confidence vote, lawmakers expressed confidence that the government was now looking more likely to withstand any challenge thanks to signals of tentative support from the left and far-right."

But even after relief reaches them, the hunger they have endured could cast a shadow over their health for years to come. More than 60,000 children in Gaza will need treatment for acute malnutrition in 2025, according to United Nations estimates from Jan. 22. Some have already died – estimates of how many vary widely. Survivors who are able to return to adequate levels of nutrition nonetheless face an insidious threat: the multiple long-term health problems linked to childhood malnutrition."

The U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth of Mexican products in 2023, a figure that has grown about 70% over the last decade, census data showed.

Secretary Kristi Noem said the publicity created around the arrests was to show that the new administration was taking a different, tougher approach. Trump's promises of mass deportations have stoked uncertainty and fear, but at least some of the arrests in New York were not a departure from how past administrations have pursued people charged with crimes, be they citizens or immigrants."

        "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign promise to impose steep tariffs on imports -- including those coming from close U.S. allies -- has some of his fellow Republicans in Congress worried about its potential hit to their home-state economies. Trump faces a self-imposed Saturday deadline to potentially slap 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as increased tariffs on Chinese goods, which could both drive up the cost of imported goods and raise the risk of retaliatory tariffs hitting exports."

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the federal workforce and is controlled by the White House, said in a Jan. 28 email , opens new tab to federal employees that workers who submit their resignation by Feb. 6 will retain their full pay and benefits through Sept. 30 without having to show up for work, except in undefined \"rare cases.\" OPM instructed workers willing to submit so-called \"deferred resignations\" to send an email to an agency account with the word \"Resign\" in the subject line."

The comments by Le Pen, who polls suggest will win France's 2027 presidential election if she is allowed to run , underline how Trump's tougher stance on immigration may come to influence policy in Europe. Although Trump is unpopular in Europe, years of immigration have dragged the continent rightward, leaving many more voters receptive to his once-unthinkable views."

In a whip-saw reversal to a policy unveiled with little explanation late on Monday, the White House budget office told federal agencies it was rescinding a memo that had ordered the pause in grant and loan payments."

Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told Reuters by telephone that fighting will halt in Goma itself because it is now controlled by the rebels. People in Goma said looting and sporadic gunfire continued on Wednesday."

The Kremlin said it favoured a resumption of transit through Ukraine, which has refused to renew an agreement to allow it on grounds it helps fund Russia's war against Kyiv. Transit through Ukraine has been an established route for sending supplies to Slovakia, Austria and ex-Soviet Moldova."

They range from broad ones - a universal tariff on foreign-imported goods - to ones aimed at specific sectors, regions, or at specific countries in an effort to get others to meet his policy demands. However, Trump's threats have changed over time, ranging from small levies to ones exceeding 200%, leaving other nations and businesses unclear of what is to come next. Here is a roundup of Trump's trade-related threats."

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the clock to 89 seconds before midnight - the theoretical point of annihilation. That is one second closer than it was set last year. The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 during the Cold War tensions that followed World War Two to warn the public about how close humankind was to destroying the world."

President Vladimir Putin casts the war, which Moscow officially calls a \"Special Military Operation\", as a difficult but necessary fight against a Western- and NATO-backed Ukraine. He says it is part of a wider existential battle against a decadent West trying to weaken and dismember Russia."

Although it is rare for such preliminary reports to go beyond factual details, the report gave no indication about what might have led the aircraft to land far down the runway without its landing gear deployed, highlighting the lack of immediate clues after the plane's black boxes stopped recording four minutes before impact."

It threatened \"disciplinary action\" for any staff ignoring the administration's orders. A sharply-worded memo sent on Saturday to more than 10,000 staff at USAID offered further guidance to Friday’s “stop-work” directive that effectively put a sweeping freeze on U.S. foreign aid worldwide. The memo, reviewed by Reuters, laid out expectations for the workforce on how to achieve Trump’s goals."

The four Israelis freed in the second swap of the week-old Gaza truce were led onto a podium in Gaza City amid a large crowd of Palestinians and surrounded by dozens of armed Hamas men. The hostages waved and smiled before being led off, entering Red Cross vehicles to be transported to Israeli forces."

Rubio, in the first telephone call between the two top diplomats under the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, told Wang that Trump, who began his second term on Monday, would pursue a relationship with China that \"advances U.S. interests and puts the American people first,\" a State Department statement said."

The translation of the comments has also been corrected to show he referred to 'a child' who would succeed him. The original story quoted him as referring to \"my son\". The Comorian word he used can mean 'child,' 'son' or 'daughter.') Comoros President Azali Assoumani said in a speech to supporters that he would \"take a child to put in my place\" when he leaves office, comments his critics interpreted as confirming their suspicions that he is grooming his son to take over."

During last year’s summit, in Azerbaijan, a bitter fight that pitted wealthy nations against lower-income countries ended with a pledge from wealthy countries to provide $300 billion a year to support developing nations by 2035. While the target is triple what the current target of $100 billion, it is only a fraction of the $1.3 trillion per year developing countries say are needed. The fight is likely to continue this year."
