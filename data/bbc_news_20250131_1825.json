    "tags": "Mixed Martial Arts",
    "text": "Michael 'Venom' Page turns 38 in April and made his pro debut in 2012\nThe last time Michael 'Venom' Page contested an MMA fight at middleweight it was in Mumbai almost 12 years ago.\nPage, then 26, was appearing in just his fifth bout and was competing in India for the second time in five months.\nThe Englishman made short work of his opponent, securing a first-round submission.\nPage, who has fought most of his career as a welterweight, has good memories of the trip and remembers how naive he was to the professional world of MMA.\n\"I was still new to the sport. I didn't know what was good and bad. You can tell what's organised or not, but you didn't know if that was normal or not,\" Page said.\n\"When we were warming up for the fight, me and my opponent were basically warming up in the same room, which is weird.\"\nFast forward to 1 February 2025 and Page is facing unbeaten UFC middleweight sensation Sharabutdin Magomedov in Saudi Arabia.\nThey will not be expected to warm up in the same room before making their walks to the octagon.\n\"Shara has that [aura] around him but I can see in his ability something I can exploit,\" Page said.\n\"If I put the 'MVP' effect in front of him, it might ruin all of that. There is just something I saw there that made sense to me.\"\nAt 15-0, seven years his junior and on the hunt for a title shot at 185lb, Magomedov  is a daunting prospect for any middleweight, let alone a fighter stepping up in weight.\n'I feel like the old dog but I'm still very dangerous'\nHughes calls judging of loss 'pretty ridiculous'\nPage, 37, has a win anda losssince joining the UFC last year. He intends to return to welterweight and has his sights set on a title run.\nBut the opportunity to fight Magomedov, who has 12 knockouts in his 15 wins, was a challenge Page couldn't turn down. And it meant Page could still enjoy his Christmas dinner.\n\"I still had a good Christmas,\" he said.\n\"If there is exciting fights to be made at middleweight, I would happily take it. But the focus is a welterweight championship belt.\n\"I'm going to try and dedicate as much as my time at welterweight to get that belt and move up in the rankings.\"\nMagomedov, 30, won his last fight in incredible fashion against Armen Petrosyan, landing a right backfist before spinning round to land the same shot with his left hand.\nPage says no-one has been able to come up with the right gameplan to beat Magomedov, but feels his own \"unorthodox\" striking style will be perfect for his opponent's aggressive approach.\n\"Nobody's got it quite right yet. My time to show everyone,\" Page said.\n\"It's going to be an explosive fight and someone will walk on to something ugly.\n\"It's a great fight which is why I think so many people are excited for it because our styles looks like it'll create fireworks.\"\nMany fans expected Page to be included on the UFC London card, but the Briton said he agreed the Magomedov fight before theUFC confirmed the 22 March date.\nPage has fought several times in London when he was in Bellator and he \"100%\" wants to fight against British rival Leon Edwards in the near future.\nHe beat bitter rival Paul Daley in a huge all-British clash in 2019, but Bellator decided to do that fight in the United States.\n\"There is no way I am going to be in the UFC and not fight on a London card,\" Page said.\n\"Paul Daley, they did abroad, it was silly. It didn't need to happen the way it happened. I was annoyed at it back then, still annoyed at it now.\n\"It definitely should have happened in the UK. There's nowhere near as much malice between me and Leon, but it's equally an exciting fight to have.\n\"But it has to happen in the UK. I wouldn't let it happen anywhere else.\"\nMMA schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

You provide a platform to a lot of dumb and ignorant people.\"\nAs leader of the Nazi party, Hitler led Germany into World War Two and ordered the Holocaust genocide, in which six million Jews were murdered.\nMitchell has been fighting in the UFC promotion since 2018.\nCanadian-American combat sports journalist Ariel Helwani, who is Jewish,said on X:,external\"Each and every day MMA finds a way to reach a new low. A new way of embarrassing itself and those who are fans of it.\"\nHe added:,external\"Nothing will be done, and I don't even care if anything is done. Say what you want. It just continues to baffle me at how unbelievably stupid - not to mention bigoted - some of the people in the sport or associated with the sport can be.\"\nIn a statement to BBC Sport, the Anti-Defamation League's chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt said: \"I'm aghast at this podcast interview.

Make sure you read her match report.\nYou can also scroll down to watch all the video highlights and end-of-day reaction.\nWe will, of course, be back tomorrow in the wee small hours at 03:00 GMT for live text commentary, and ball-by-ball coverage from the Test Match Special team, on day two.\nBetween now and then here's a few more cricket stories for you to read:\nEngland seamer Lauren Bell:\"It was up and down as Test cricket is. We dug pretty deep to get a total and had a lot of energy. As a seam bowler, it's a nice surface to bowl on. It’s got a lot of lateral movement so we’ll just have to play with that.\n\"Test match cricket is special, it feels quite separate from the rest of the series. You’re playing a Test match at MCG, it’s exciting, everyone gets excited about it. Our focus was on this, we parked the rest of the series. With the pink ball, it’s definitely learning on the job but it’s fun. Kate Cross brings that consistency and trust, I've had to step into those shoes but I love when Heather gives me those opportunities. Personally, I've got a lot out of the series but we’ll see how the rest goes.\n\"As a team we’ll reflect but personally, I can take a bit of confidence from how the past few games have gone. I feel pretty confident of where I’m at. It’s amazing to play at the MCG. As a cricketer you try to take in all these things. It’s cool you’ve just got to embrace it and enjoy it. We can definitely get a result, a few early wickets tomorrow, we’ll see how it plays out. Australia showed us how to bowl on this pitch but we’ll see how it plays out tomorrow.\"\nGeorgia ElwissEngland all-rounder on TNT Sports\nAlana King has got a lovely action, she puts a lot of revolutions on the ball. I know she idolised Shane Warne growing up and it's really fitting for her that she's on her home ground and has been able to make the ball talk.\nShe's a fantastic bowler and she sets brilliant plans to different batters as well. We saw how she set up Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge. She knows exactly the ball that she's trying to bowl.\nOnce she got into her groove, it looked like she was going to get a wicket every single ball she bowled. The skill level and the control she had, particularly for a leg-spinner, is unbelievable.\nAustralia bowler player Darcie Brown:\"It was a really positive day for us. It’s always nice to bowl them out on the first day and have a bat. We’ve only lost one wicket which puts us in  a good position for tomorrow.\n\"It was good fun, anytime we get to play Test matches it's fun, to get a few overs in is nice for us bowlers. In my limited experience, it didn't swing as much as I thought it would, in these conditions as well. It was a challenge in the end when it didn't do much but it was fun.\n\"I think the ball got softer but it's hard to tell when our spinners are getting wickets. Something we spoke about was it getting softer. We tried to keep it off the ground because of the dew. I'm not a good pitch assessor but it had good bounce. It was interesting to bowl on.\n\"We like to try out a few things that we don't get to in T20s and ODIs. It's nice to get out there, try things and see what happens. It's super special to play here [at the MCG]. Only a few girls had played BBL here before. It’s pretty special, there's a good turnout and lots of family and friends here which makes it even better.\"\nEngland batter Danni Wyatt-Hodge, speaking to TNT Sports:\"It was really tough. It was one of those pitches where you really had to grind for your runs.\n\"[Alana King] was absolutely ragging it on day one as well so it is what it is. It's what's happen over this whole Ashes series. We would have liked maybe another 50 runs there.\n\"We've got to bring the energy and bowl really well and hopefully get a few early wickets tomorrow.\"\nOn the pitch:\"It's quite furry. Anything top of the stumps is quite tough. Anything really full was really nice, you could get your hands through.\n\"But if you bowl top of the stumps, it's really difficult to get the ball away. So it's about being proactive and hitting the bad ball.\"\nOn Sophie Ecclestone:\"She's going to be key. She's been exceptional for us over the years. Hopefully she can bowl exceptionally well tomorrow as well.\"\nEngland did manage to take one wicket in the evening session, when Lauren Bell had debutante Georgia Voll caught by wicketkeeper Amy Jones.\nAustralia recovered from 19-1 to reach 56-1 at the close and would appear well positioned to resume on day two in favourable conditions during the daytime.\nThis video can not be played\nBell removes Voll as England take early wicket\nSteven FinnFormer England fast bowler on TNT Sports\nAlana King has been devastating all the way through this series. It's a mixture of drift and spin that has done it for her.\nDrifting in, turning away - they're almost unplayable deliveries. Shane Warne-esque.\nI think she even bowled from the Shane Warne End today so quite fitting that she was getting the ball to rip and spit so much.\nKing was brave, she kept looping it up. A fantastic spell of bowling, mixing up her pace, mixing up her drift.\nSrinivas VijaykumarCricviz analyst\nAlana King in the previous two Ashes series had a total of 10 wickets in nine matches.  In this Ashes series, she's almost doubled her tally wickets with another innings left to play.\nAlana King in Women's Ashes\n\n2025 (in Australia):\nIn Women's Ashes 2023 (in England)\nIn Women's Ashes 2022 (in Australia)\nSteven FinnFormer England fast bowler on TNT Sports\nAlana King bowled brilliantly, she controlled the scoring rate, she was playful with the way she used her drift and her flight in order to get those four England wickets.\nShe deserved five.\nA few of England's dismissals were soft, to put it mildly. Sophie Ecclestone and Amy Jones were perhaps the most culpable of giving their wickets away cheaply.\nLeg-spinner Alana King finished with an impressive 4-45 from 23 overs while Ash Gardner claimed 1-30.\nEngland would have hoped for more than 170 in their first innings.\nThis video can not be played\nEcclestone chips it straight to Garth\nThis video can not be played\nGardner 'beauty' bowls Jones\nMichelle GoszkoEx-Australia batter on BBC Sounds\nI thought Nat Sciver-Brunt was the best batter for England today.\nNat Sciver-Brunt was the one England batter to really defy the Aussies, albeit with a bit of luck along the way, as she top scored with 51.\nShe eventually fell to Alana King.\nThis video can not be played\nSciver-Brunt survives as catch is grounded\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Best of Sciver-Brunt\nThis video can not be played\nKing clean bowls Sciver-Brunt\nA quick recap of what's happened on day one of this one-off Women's Ashes Test then...\nEngland lost the toss and were asked to bat first by Alyssa Healy.\nAustralia's seamers, and Kim Garth and Darcie Brown did the early damage at the top of the order before their spinners took charge.\nThis video can not be played\nGarth dismisses Bouchier first over in 'perfect start' for Australia\nThis video can not be played\nEngland captain Knight out lbw\nThis video can not be played\nWyatt-Hodge falls to King's spin\nMichelle GoszkoEx-Australia batter on BBC Sounds\nEngland have had a tough day.

    "text": "Rangers winger Vaclav Cerny scores the winner against Union Saint-Gilloise\nWinger Vaclav Cerny insists manager Philippe Clement is handling the pressure after guiding Rangers directly through to the Europa League last 16.\nThe Ibrox side will face one of Bodo/Glimt, Anderlecht, Twente or Fenerbahce in March, skipping the play-off round, after finishing eighth in the table thanks to the 2-1 win over Union Saint-Gilloise and other results falling in their favour.\nClement's future has come under intense scrutiny this season, but Czech international Cerny said: \"I think he's dealing with pressure every three days.\n\"He's dealing with it very good, as we are, because we play for a big club. That is how it should be.\n\"That's normal and I like the way that we stick together. We stick together no matter what and we can put in big performances.\"\nCerny scored what proved to be the winner, his 13th goal of the season, before the Belgian side staged a late, unsuccessful fightback that had Ibrox on edge.\nDirect entry to the last 16 is undoubtedly a significant achievement, particularly given four of Rangers' opponents finished in the top seven.\n\"It's a big one,\" Cerny added. \"That's what we wanted before it all started and we had some tough opponents.\n\"I think it's a very, very good achievement to go into the top eight.\n\"Obviously the dream of ours is to go as far as possible. We need to wait and focus for the very first opponent.\n\"I don't think we have had a bad game in Europe this season. We were just well prepared for every single game.\"",

    "text": "Golden State Warriors are 11th in the Western Conference\nThe Golden State Warriors withstood a 52-point haul from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to beat Western Conference leaders Oklahoma Thunder 116-109.\nCanada's Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points in the first half as his side led 58-48 at the break but Golden State fought back to pull away for victory.\nThe home side were led by Andrew Wiggins's 27 points, while Stephen Curry scored 17 of his 21 in the second half.\n\"We just stayed solid. Just all around effort,\" said Curry.\n\"We need every win possible. We haven't really developed anything consistent in terms of the win column. So this is a great test.\"\nDespite defeat, Thunder remain top of the Western Conference while Golden State improve their record to 24-23.\nIn Wednesday's other matches, the Cleveland Cavaliers maintained their lead over defending champions the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference with victory over the Miami Heat.\nThe Cavs, who were missing Darius Garland, Caris LeVert and Isaac Okoro, were led by 34 points from Donovan Mitchell in a 126-106 win.\nThe Celtics thumped the Chicago Bulls 122-100 with Kristaps Porzingis sinking eight three-pointers in his score of 34.\nElsewhere, there were wins for the New York Knicks over the Denver Nuggets, the Indiana Pacers against the Detroit Pistons, while the Los Angeles Clippers beat the San Antonio Spurs.\nMeanwhile, NBA commissioner Adam Silver has raised the possibility of switching from 12-minute to 10-minute quarters.\nSpeaking on The Dan Patrick Show, he cited an evolving television audience and the need to align with international rules as reasons for the potential change.\nSilver added it is not something the league is actively considering and acknowledged it would need further study to be implemented.\n\"I'm a fan of four 10-minute quarters. I'm not sure that many others are,\" he said.\n\"It's such a dramatic change to the game. I think something like that would have to be talked more about over time.\"\nThe NBA has played 48-minute games throughout its history, but Olympic and other international games are 40 minutes long, while US collegiate men's games are played in two 20-minute periods.\nShould the NBA make the change, it would likely make some single-game and single-season records impossible to break.\n\"Because this game is so global, one of the things we'd like to see over time is creating a more consistent set of rules globally around the game,\" added Silver.\n\"Putting aside what it would mean for records and things like that, I think that a two-hour format for a game is more consistent for modern television habits.\"",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Rachel Reeves is set to announce a series of major infrastructure projects in a speech in which she is also expected to back plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport.\nThe chancellor will outline plans to create \"Europe's Silicon Valley\" between Oxford and Cambridge, reaffirming support for a railway which is already under construction between the two university cities.\nThe series of announcements come as the chancellor faces pressure to deliver on the government's main pledge to grow the UK economy in order to boost living standards.\nEncouraging plans for the expansion of Heathrow is likely to spark strong opposition, but Reeves will say the quest for growth \"will not come without a fight\".\nThe Conservatives have criticised Labour's plans as \"hastily cobbled together\".\nOn Wednesday, Reeves will declare that the UK's economy has \"huge potential\" but will add \"for too long, that potential has been held back\".\n\"Low growth is not our destiny. But growth will not come without a fight. Without a government that is on the side of working people. Willing to take the right decisions now to change our country's course for the better,\" she will say.\nThe BBC understands there will be no public money for Heathrow and any of the other projects being announced in the speech which will aim to \"kick start\" economic growth.\nThe projects to be announced include:\nA third runway at Heathrow would cost tens of billions of pounds and take more than a decade to complete, however, theexpansion plans at Gatwick and Luton airports, if approved, are due to start during this parliament.\nThe government cannot prejudge the results of a formal planning application for a specific runway scheme.\nHeathrow has long argued the expansion is needed to help it keep up with rival airports in Europe, which handle less passengers with more runways, with the airport's boss saying a \"clear steer\" was needed from the government by the end of 2025.\nBut many airlines have already expressed concern at the likely costs and there are many within the Labour party who have been against previous expansion plans.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan's office told the BBC he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.\nDale Vince, the boss of energy company Ecotricity, who donated £5m to Labour in the run-up to the general election told the BBC's Today programme expanding Heathrow would be a \"mistake\".\n\"It'll take 10 years to build a runway, cost maybe £50bn . It'll create the wrong kind of growth - we'll be exporting tourism money abroad, creating a bigger imbalance than we already have, and it will come at the expense of our carbon-cutting effort,\" he said.\nThe government wants thousands of homes and a new rail link to be developed in the area between Oxford and Cambridge. Reevescommitted to deliver East-West Rail in her Budget last year.\nRestrictive planning has long stunted the growth of the economy in the area, especially among companies linked to world leading scientific discoveries.  There will also be new reservoirs and funding for specialist hospitals.\n\"To grow, these world-class companies need world-class talent who should be able to get to work quickly and find somewhere to live in the local area. But to get from Oxford to Cambridge by train takes two and a half hours,\" the chancellor will say.\n\"Oxford and Cambridge offer huge economic potential for our nation's growth prospects.\"\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds warned the UK risked being \"left behind\" if it did not build new infrastructure.\n\"We simply cannot afford to say we don't build reservoirs any more, we don't build railways, we don't build runways. That's not good enough,\" he told the BBC.\nThe biggest of initiatives to be confirmed are centred in the south east of England, raising some questions about the government's commitment to the \"levelling up\" agenda.\nBut the government will also review the so-called Green Book rules, which is guidance issued by the Treasury on how to appraise policies, programmes and projects.\nNew powers in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill aim to cut years off the length periods it has taken to improve major infrastructure.\nA senior minister said they were taking big long term decisions ignored by previous governments in the knowledge that \"the benefit won't be achieved until after this parliament, but they are the right long term decisions\".\nThe Treasury is confident that there will be \"spades in the ground well before that\".\nLabour has been talking about the importance of economic growth in the months before the general election and in the months after.\nHowever, despite the government's words on growth, the economy remains sluggish.\nFigures from January revealed growth in November, but the 0.1% expansion was less than expected.\nThe economy has stuttered and stumbled and critics have argued a sense of gloom and pessimism from ministers over the summer and into the autumn made matters worse. Some ministers acknowledge privately that with hindsight they got that wrong.\nThe Conservatives criticised Labour's growth plans.\n\"Hastily cobbled together announcements of growth in the 2030s will do nothing to help the businesses cutting jobs right now,\" said shadow chancellor Mel Stride.\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: \"Trying to boost growth without fixing our trading relationship with Europe is like driving with the handbrake on.\"\nThe Lib Dems are calling for \"a new UK-EU customs union that would put rocket boosters under the economy\".\nA trade body calls the rise in alcohol tax a \"bitter blow\", but there is better news for pub-goers.\nThe chancellor announces projects in England's south as infrastructure in the North East crumbles.\nIn choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some tricky navigation - and it will make big domestic political waves too\nRachel Reeves has said she would now support any expansion, despite previously opposing the plans.\nThe chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.",

    "text": "The Daily Telegraph says government plans being announced to set aside about a 10th of English farmland for net zero and to protect wildlife are a fresh blow to rural life. While the paper says the Environment Secretary, Steve Reed, will insist that his plans won't impose changes, it suggests that the proposals are likely to reignite Labour's row with farmers, who are said to be worried that the plans will lead to ministers telling them what they can grow. A government spokesman said the framework would not tell anyone what to do with their land.\nThe prime minister is challenged by the Daily Mail to prove he is serious about economic growth, and sign off two North Sea oil and gas fields blocked by a judge in Scotland. The Scottish High Court ruled that final permission for drilling in the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields must now be granted by regulators and the Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband. The paper urges Sir Keir Starmer to overrule Miliband and greenlight the projects, which it says could generate billions of pounds for the economy.\nMeanwhile,the Guardian describes a National Audit Office report on violence against women as highly critical of government attempts to tackle the issue. The previous government launched a major drive to address the problem four years after the murders of Sabina Nessa and Sarah Everard. But the watchdog's review of that strategy found that it had not helped victims, or delivered long-term societal change. The Home Office said the report exposed the previous government's failure, and that it would have a new strategy in the spring.\nThe Times says the attorney general is facing what it calls strong criticism from cabinet ministers about changes he made last year to how departments receive legal advice on policy. Lord Hermer KC told government lawyers they had to advise ministers if a policy was unlawful. Ministers told the paper that the attorney general had been too stringent, and that the new advice was delaying policies when there was only a slim chance they could be beaten in court. A government spokesman said policy decisions were taken by the relevant secretary of state.\nAccording to theTelegraph, official figures show that out of every £15 spent by the government on benefits last year,one pound was either fraudulently claimed or was paid by mistake. Estimates from the Department for Work and Pensions suggest that nearly £10bn of taxpayers money went on bogus or erroneous claims. The figures were contained in a report by the Commons Public accounts committee which said the level of waste was unacceptably high. A DWP spokesman said the report had failed to take into account a new government bill to stop errors and fraud.\nThe Daily Express writes that the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, says he would deliver the kind of Brexit people voted for if he was prime minister. He says that the UK needs a government that truly believes in being outside the European Union, which the UK left five years ago today.\nAnd almost all the papers feature photos of Marianne Faithfull, the singer and actor who died yesterday aged 78.The Guardian calls her a sixties icon, whilefor the Telegraph, she was the Queen of Bohemia.\nSign up for our morning newsletterand get BBC News in your inbox.",

Now that hope has been taken from me.\"\nThe court heard Baldwin had a history of violent offences including attacking women and smashing a bottle over a man's head before stabbing him with the shards.\nMr Justice Constable said Baldwin \"exploited\" Ms McIntyre's vulnerability through alcohol and the killing was an \"escalation of the pattern of domestic violence against her\".\nHe said the murder scene was one of \"indescribable horror\" and the attack was carried out with \"extreme ferocity\".\nThe judge said Ms McIntyre was a \"kind friend to many\" and \"much loved mother and grandmother\".\nBaldwin, who also admitted affray and possessing a blade in a public place for his offences on the bus, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years and 46 weeks.\nFollow BBC North East onX,Facebook,NextdoorandInstagram.

    "text": "Sean Lynn is aiming to win a third-straight league title with Gloucester-Hartpury this season\nGloucester-Hartpury head coach Sean Lynn said it was a \"really tough\" decision to leave the club, after being announced as Wales'new head coachlast week.\nThe Swansea-born coach has been in charge of the Premiership Women's Rugby champions for five years and will be finishing the 2024-25 campaign before moving to the national side full-time.\nGloucester-Hartpury have been transformed under Lynn's leadership into the dominant force in domestic English rugby, winning back-to-back league titles, while they currently top of the table with three games to go.\n\"It was a real difficult decision. I've been involved in GH for five years, the success we've had, the environment we're creating, it's a great run,\" Lynn told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.\n\"But to be head coach of my own country. I was brought up in Swansea in Wales, I'm a proud Welshman - I couldn't turn down that opportunity.\"\nLynn to unlock Wales' potential by creating 'one family'\nLynn named new Wales women head coach\nLynn, who also oversees all aspects of the women's rugby programme at Hartpury College and University set-up, will take charge of Wales for the first time during the Six Nations.\nHe already coaches a large contingent of Welsh internationals at Gloucester-Hartpury, with captain Hannah Jones, prop Sisilia Tuipulotu, fly-half Lleucu George and hooker Kelsey Jones among them.\nGloucester-Hartpury currently hold a three-point lead in the Premiership ahead of Harlequins and a 10-point advantage on Bristol Bears in fifth, with the top four teams qualifying for the play-offs.\nSince the start of December they have won their past six league games - including against three of their four top four rivals. They place Leicester Tigers away in their next game on Saturday.\n\"It's something we set out in June, July, let's get a home semi-final, it's knock-out rugby, it's what we enjoy, and my full focus is on Gloucester-Hartpury and making sure we can [do that],\" Lynn added.\n\"We said in the meeting on Monday, where we've come from just before Christmas, playing all those top four teams and coming away with max points it's incredible.\n\"I'm super proud of the group of players and staff that we've got. That job has been done and now it's looking to build going into knockout stages.\"\nEngland and Gloucester-Hartpury back row Georgia Brock said there will be \"a lot of change\" at the club, after Lynn's departure but that they now have extra motivation to win the title this season.\n\"It's a lot of change but hats off to him, credit to him, he's obviously put a lot of work and effort into this job the past five years,\" Brock said.\n\"We as a group are very proud of him and we want to give him the best send-off we can with the top four coming to the end of the season, we want to give him a home semi-final - that's the main aim.\n\"It motivates us even more.\"",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "Welsh Rugby, Rugby Union",
    "text": "Warren Gatland is preparing for his 17th Six Nations tournament as a head coach having also led Ireland in four competitions\nMen's Six Nations: France v Wales\nVenue:Stade de FranceDate:Friday, 31 JanuaryKick-off:20:15 GMT\nCoverage:Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC 5 Live; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on S4C.\nParis on a Friday night. Probably not how struggling Wales would have chosen to kick off their Six Nations campaign, or how Warren Gatland might have wanted to celebrate his 150th game in charge of his adopted nation.\nThe lack of expectation heading into the tournament from the Welsh public has probably never been matched. That includes the dark days of the 1990s.\nMost are fearful of a second successive Wooden Spoon with only two wins in the previous 16 games in the tournament.\nWales have been given odds of 22-1 at the bookmakers to win the opening game in Paris. They are 80-1 outsiders for the Six Nations title and one particular predictor gives Gatland's side just a 0.2% chance of achieving that feat.\nNew Wales scrum consultant Adam Jones summed it up neatly when asked about hope of a victory in France.\n\"The whole country and rugby world thinks we are going to go there and get pumped,\" said Jones.\nCaptain Jac Morgan, however, says Gatland's side are determined to prove people wrong as they aim to banish the negativity that has engulfed Welsh rugby.\nThis video can not be played\nSix Nations 2025: Wales must adopt siege mentality - Warren Gatland\nFollow Wales on the BBC in the 2025 Six Nations\nSix players to watch out for in the Six Nations\nFrance v Wales match preview, coverage & key stats\nGatland will raise his metaphorical bat when he reaches 150 games in charge of Wales. The nation will be hoping there is no cricket score in France's premier rugby venue.\nHis overall record stands at 149 matches with 76 wins, 71 defeats and two draws over two stints in charge of Wales.\nThe two spells are starkly contrasting. During his first 12-year tenure, Gatland recorded 70 wins in 125 games with 53 defeats and two draws, a success rate of 56%.\nHe guided Wales to three Grand Slams and two World Cup semi-finals, while taking sabbaticals to lead the British and Irish Lions to a series victory against Australia in 2013 and a draw against New Zealand four years later.\nWales briefly topped the world rankings in August 2019 but in just over five years Gatland's side have gone from being the world's best to Wales' worst.\nSecond time around Gatland has presided over statistically the most dismal run in their 144-year international rugby history with 12 successive Test losses.\nSince returning to replace fellow New Zealander Wayne Pivac in December 2022, he has managed only six wins and 18 losses in 24 matches, a success rate of just 25%.\nThis video can not be played\nWales have forgotten how to lose - Warren Gatland reflects on 2019 win in Paris\nSix years ago almost to the day, Wales opened their Six Nations campaign against France in Paris and completed a remarkable second-half comeback to seal victory on the way to a Grand Slam.\nIt was a 10th successive win during a record 14-match streak with Gatland boasting afterwards his side had forgotten how to lose. Currently they cannot remember how to win.\nAs Gatland enters his 13th Six Nations campaign with Wales, he will hope he can avoid a 13th successive Test loss.\nOctober 2023 was Wales' most recent international victory when Gatland's side defeated Georgia in the final World Cup pool match in Nantes. Some 482 days or almost 16 months ago - whichever you prefer.\nA dismal dozen Test defeats - 11 of those in a calendar year - have followed, with losses against Argentina, England, Ireland, France, Italy, Scotland and Fiji, a couple against South Africa and a hat-trick of failures against Australia.\nThe wretched run of results has seen Wales slip to all-time low of 11th in the world rankings.\nWrite Wales off at your peril - Gatland\nWales must adopt siege mentality - Gatland\nJones aims to help lift Wales in Six Nations role\nThis video can not be played\nWales can win the 2025 Six Nations - Gatland\nGatland looked a broken man at times during the latter stages of 2024 but has been publicly defiant before this latest campaign.\nPre-tournament comments have included how he believes Wales can win the tournament, how he is building \"a siege mentality\" and how people should write his side off \"at their peril\".\nHe has also tried to heap pressure on France by stating he hopes Wales \"can catch them cold\" and highlighted the pressure his opposite number Fabien Galthie faces to defeat Wales comfortably.\nIn 2019, Gatland said if Wales beat France they would go on to win the Six Nations - exactly what happened.\nSix years ago, you believed those swaggering sentiments. He also had the tools at his disposal to back up his actions with words.\nNow it feels the Gatland soundbites are the right things to say but you wonder whether he believes them himself.\nSpeculation is rife this will be his final tournament, whatever might happen over the next two months. Gatland has accepted change is likely if signs of improvement are not shown during the Six Nations.\nThe 61-year-old has spoken himself about whether he needs the pressure and whether he could just retire to his beach house in New Zealand and reflect on his memorable achievements in the game.\nWelsh Rugby Union (WRU) chief executive Abi Tierney said Gatland's position had been \"on the line\" as a review into the miserable autumn campaign commenced earlier this season.\nHe was given the green light to continue with another detailed assessment planned after Wales finish the tournament at home to England in mid-March.\nThere have been changes to Gatland's staff. As well as scrum consultant Jones coming in, attack coach Alex King has left with Rob Howley taking over those responsibilities. How much that can influence events remains to be seen.\nWilliams, Adams and Jenkins return for Wales' Six Nations opener\nFit-again Ntamack returns for France against Wales\nWilliams back on track to join Wales 100-cap club\nThis video can not be played\n'A lot are writing us off'\nThis year Wales open the Six Nations in Paris on the last day of January - six years ago that tournament-opening away win in France was on the first day of February.\nComparisons are difficult to make. That Welsh side was full of experienced players with British and Irish Lions Test performers.\nContinuity of selection has become an issue; Wales have only four starters from the side that lost to South Africa in November.\nThey have been bolstered by the return of Liam Williams and Josh Adams and the selection of the experienced Nick Tompkins and Owen Watkin in midfield.\nInfluential scrum-half Tomos Williams is back, while Morgan leads the side in the absence of the injured Dewi Lake, but Wales say number eight Taulupe Faletau is not fit for the French test.\nGatland has given hooker Evan Lloyd and prop Henry Thomas first Wales starts, while Ben Thomas, normally a centre, starts at fly-half for only a third time in international rugby with 21-year-old uncapped Dan Edwards on the bench.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nWales might have enjoyed previous Paris success but France have won the past six games in this rivalry.\nLes Bleus were unbeaten in the autumn which included a victory against New Zealand and still have former Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards in the ranks.\nThey have injuries to centre Gael Fickou, lock Thibaud Flament, flanker Charles Ollivon and wing Damian Penuad that might give Wales some faint hope.\nThere is still, though, the little matter of scrum-half Antoine Dupont. Among many headline acts on show at Stade de France, none is more in demand than the France captain.\nWidely regarded as the world's best player, he returns to the Six Nations arena after missing last season's tournament while he concentrated on the Paris Olympics and being part of France's sevens squad.\nA year on, he can admire a gold medal, in addition to helping his club Toulouse land a Champions Cup and French league double, while also orchestrating Les Bleus' triumph against the All Blacks.\nDupont is also reunited at Test level with half-back partner Romain Ntamack for the first time in 17 months.\nThe dynamic duo's presence will lift the decibel level at Stade de France, and Wales face a Herculean task trying to silence it.\nWales initially named a 34-man squad for the 2025 Six Nations before later adding Ospreys prop Ben Warren\nFew people really expect Wales to win in France. But whatever happens in the Parisian late evening, Welsh rugby needs something, anything, from this tournament.\nJust a glimmer of hope to emerge from the doom and gloom. A blueprint of what this Wales side represents, what they can become.\nYes, Wales have lost a golden generation of players and do have some talented youngsters but people are becoming tired of talk of building towards the 2027 World Cup. They want progress. Now.\nThe state of the game in Wales cannot be laid solely at the door of Gatland or his Wales national side. Nor should it.\nThe relative success of the Wales men's squad over previous years has papered over the cracks of the mismanagement of the game.\nThe cash-strapped four Welsh professional sides are struggling, despite a few optimistic glimpses this season. Interest is generally waning, with crowds down, apart from at Cardiff.\nWelsh rugby is used to peaks and troughs, ecstatic highs and wretched lows with not much in between. This current malaise is comparable to any of the previous \"rock bottom\" scenarios.\nWelsh rugby has lifted itself out of such holes before. Long-suffering supporters will hope this Friday night in Paris can be the start of another such voyage.\nThis video can not be played\nDrama, despair & smelly socks - pundits relive Six Nations days\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "We asked for your thoughts afterThursday's Europa League gamebetween FCSB and Manchester United.\nHere are some of your comments:\nPeter:AlejandroGarnacho and Kobbie Mainoo must not leave this team. When United were more aggressive in the second half, they looked much better. There is still a long way to go but things are looking better, and clean sheets give confidence to the whole team. Maybe it's a good time to bring in a couple more of the academy lads, rather than spending on highly-priced poor players.\nYusuf:Brilliant performance from United. We are the only team in the Europa League not to lose a game. Mainoo was fantastic on the left wing - he really adjusted to that position well. Rasmus Hojlund had a lot of chances to get on the scoresheet but none were successful. We struggled to score in the first half but were able to come back in the second half with some fantastic finishes from Diogo Dalot and Mainoo as well.\nAdam:I was left shaking my head in frustration at the end of the first period. However, the half-time tweaks were inspired and suddenly United took the game by the scruff of the neck and totally obliterated any resolve FCSB had left. Could this be a sign of things to come from Amorim's team? If so, the future is bright!\nMark:A performance that makes us happier - for once. Ruben Amorim made controlled substitutions, Mainoo in a new position worked and Garnacho has to stay unless it is ridiculous money.\nIain:Amad Diallo, Garnacho and Mainoo provided a lot of youthful energy when they were on the pitch. We were defensively solid with our back three and had decent possession all game, starving the opposition to a handful of half-chances. It is crucial to avoid extra matches in February and have more time on the training pitch. Amorim has done well.",

Roberts was given a one-year suspended sentence, 100 hours unpaid work and 20 rehabilitation days.\nThe court heard how the two dogs could have killed Mr Franklin had it not been for a \"heroic\" neighbour who fought them off with a spirit level.\nPolice marksmen shot both dogs dead at the scene.\nJudge William Ashworth said Taylor had been officially warned about neighbours' concerns and advised she was in breach of the tenancy agreement by keeping the dogs at the house.\nA series of warnings over the aggression shown by the dogs was issued and ignored, the judge added.\nThe last warning came two days before Mr Franklin was attacked.\nJudge Ashworth told Taylor: \"It is a scene of utter horror and terror for a man to be pulled about, stripped of his clothes and all four limbs savaged over 11 minutes.\n\"The experience and terror is beyond anyone's comprehension.

    "tags": "",
    "text": "The Democratic Republic of Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi is not taking part in regionally brokered talks aimed at ending the rebel assault on the key eastern city of Goma, state media has reported.\nKenyan leader William Ruto had invited Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to a virtual summit, as corpses lay on the streets of Goma following heavy fighting.\nNeighbouring Rwanda is accused of backing the M23 rebel group, which has taken over much of the city, including its airport.\nAbout 280 Romanian mercenaries who were fighting on the side of DR Congo's army had surrendered to M23,the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) said on X.\nRwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo told the BBC that Rwanda would take part in the summit, but did not say whether Kagame would attend.\nThe UN says there is extensive evidence that Rwanda is backing the M23 but Rwanda denies giving the rebels direct military support.\nGoma was mostly quiet on Wednesday, with reports of sporadic gunfire in some districts.\nResidents who had been hiding in safe areas ventured out to buy food that is becoming increasingly scarce following days of fighting.\nBoth the UN and the southern African regional bloc SADC have peacekeepers in Goma, but they failed to halt the rebel assault.\nSpeaking to BBC Newshour while being locked down in a UN bunker in the city, the deputy head of the UN force, Vivian van de Perre, said the M23 rebels had \"established\" themselves in Goma, but were still facing \"pockets of resistance\".\nShe added that after she held talks with the M23, UN peacekeepers were starting to move around, which was \"extremely urgent because some of our bases had run out of food and water and are literally sheltering thousands of people\" - including some government soldiers who had surrendered.\nIn an apparent attempt to extend their territorial control, M23 rebels are now advancing towards Bukavu, eastern DR Congo's second biggest city, Reuters news agency quotes five diplomatic and security sources as saying. The BBC has not been able to verify this information.\nDR Congo's official news agency said that Tshisekedi would not attend the heads of state summit called by Kenya's leader in his capacity as chairman of the East African Community (EAC). It did not give a reason for his decision.\nMs van de Perre said she hoped that the fighting would not worsen ethnic tensions.\n\"We have seen some evidence of ethnic tensions being on the rise and this is everybody's worst nightmare,\" she told the BBC.\nThe M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group in DR Congo.\nRwanda's leader is also a Tutsi, and accuses DR Congo's government of harbouring Hutu militias who were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.\nSince the beginning of the week, clashes between M23 rebels and the army and its allies left hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and bodies on the streets, according to the UN.\nWarehouses with food and medical supplies were also looted, aid agencies said.\nEssential services have been unavailable since the offensive began, with electricity, water and internet cut.\nGrowing anger over the rebel offensive led to protesters targeting foreign embassies in the capital, Kinshasa.\nAt least 10  embassies were damaged and looted by protesters who demanded that the international community intervene to end the rebel assault, as they tightened their grip on Goma.\nRwanda's military said the Romanian mercenaries were being transported to Rwanda's capital, Kigali, after they had \"surrendered to M23 following the capture of the strategic city\".\nBut a UN peacekeeper told the BBC that the Romanians had sought refuge at a UN base in Goma, and were then evacuated to Rwanda.\nThe coordinator of the group, Constantin Timofti, told Romanian news channel TVR that four of his men were wounded in the clashes but were in a stable condition.\nRomania's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that the group numbered more than 250, and were private contractors working for the DR Congo government as part of a military training mission.\nDozens of them were seen on Wednesday in Gisenyi, just across the Rwandan border from Goma, being searched by officers.\n\"We weren't on a battlefield. We were here to train and help with artillery,\" one, who only gave the name Emile, told AFP news agency.\n\"What I learned is that anything can happen. I came. I did my work and now I am happy to go back and be with my family,\" he added.\nIn 2022, DR Congo's government signed contracts with two private military companies to bolster its forces against the rebels.\nThe Romanian personnel had played a crucial role in securing key installations, including the airport, and had manned checkpoints on the outskirts of Goma, until the latest rebel assault.\nDR Congo's government accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels to exploit the region's mineral wealth, an accusation Kagame's government denies.\nThe region is rich in minerals such as gold and coltan, a key ingredient in making mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica\nM23 rebels have made rapid advances in the latest bout of conflict that has long-dogged the mineral-rich east.\nDays of heavy fighting between M23 rebels and DR Congo's army leave hospitals overwhelmed with patients.\nA Rwandan spokesperson denies the charges, saying it is trying to prevent the conflict spilling over.\nPolice were called to the scene as the lawmakers tussled with each other and damaged property.\nA selection of the week's best photos from across the African continent and beyond.",

    "text": "The black boxes for a passenger plane that hit a military helicopter above Washington DC have been found, as questions mount about staffing and close calls at the airport where the plane was landing.\nNormally two people manage air traffic control for helicopters and airplanes flying in the area - one of the most controlled airspaces in the world - but only one person was doing so at the time of Wednesday's crash, according to sources cited by the BBC's US partner CBS News.\nOfficials are still investigating the cause of the incident, believed to have killed all 67 people on the two aircraft.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary report would be issued in 30 days.\nThe flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, known as the black boxes,  can help offer clues to investigators aboutwhat may have gone wrong on the flight.\nAccording to the NTSB, late on Thursday night both boxes were transported to one of its labs for evaluation.\nIn other developments on Thursday, air traffic control staffing numbers, first reported by the New York Times, was noted as \"not normal\", according to a preliminary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) report.\nThe federal government has struggled for years to fill certain key positions at the FAA.\nThe type of staffing that had one air traffic control worker managing both the helicopters and planes at the Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night is reportedly not uncommon and did not breach guidelines.\nDivers spent most of Thursday swimming through the icy waters of the Potomac River, searching for the bodies of victims.\nThe search was suspended on Thursday evening due to dangerous conditions.\nThere were 64 passengers aboard the American Airlines flight that collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter that was on a training mission flight. Three soldiers were on board.\nTeams have so far recovered 27 bodies from the plane and one from the helicopter.\nAt a White House briefing on Thursday, President Donald Trump began with a moment of silence and a prayer for victims.\nHe said \"we can only begin to imagine the agony that you're all feeling\", adding, \"our hearts are shattered alongside yours\".\nTrump speculatedon the cause of the collision, suggesting without evidence that lower hiring standards for air traffic controllers in the FAA under previous administrations run by Democrats may have been a factor.\nLater on Thursday, he signed a memorandum to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the aviation sector.\nDEI programmes aim to promote participation in workplaces by people from a range of backgrounds. Backers say they address historical or ongoing discrimination and underrepresentation but critics argue they can themselves be discriminatory.\nTrump also signed an executive order to appoint a new head of the FAA.\nThe fatal incident happened at about 21:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, when a PSA Airlines jet operating as American Airlines 5342 collided mid-air with a US Army helicopter as it approached Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\nBoth aircraft careened into the Potomac River. The passenger plane broke into multiple pieces and sank several feet into the water, while the helicopter ended up upside down in the river.\nThe plane, a Bombardier CRJ700, had departed from Wichita, Kansas, and was carryingdozens of passengers, including a pair of young figure skaters, their mothers, and two Russian coaches.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted in Russia media saying: \"There were other of our fellow citizens on board. It's bad news today from Washington.\n\"We are sorry and send our condolences to families and friends.\"\nOn Friday, China confirmed two of its nationals died in the crash and expressed \"deep condolences\".\nChina urged the US \"to promptly update it on the progress of the search and rescue operations, swiftly clarify the cause of the accident and properly handle follow-up matters\", a spokesperson for Beijing's foreign ministry said.\nThe helicopter was a Sikorsky H-60 that took off from Fort Belvoir in Virginia with three soldiers on board, and belonged to B Company, 12th Aviation Battalion.\n\"It's a tragedy, a horrible loss of life for those 64 souls on that civilian airliner, and of course the three soldiers in that Black Hawk [helicopter],\" said new defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of responses.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe president started his White House news conference as \"consoler-in-chief\" but then pivoted into unevidenced political blame, writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.\nThe concert, which also featured Dr Dre and Pink, took place to help raise funds to rebuild the LA area.\nNew drug suzetrigine, known by its brand name Journavx, has been approved to treat moderate to severe pain.",

    "text": "This video can not be played\nIdah scores double to draw Celtic level\nWe asked for your views on Celtic's 4-2 defeat at Aston Villa in the Champions League.\nHere are some of your comments:\nMark:Overall, proud of the performance. The fight we showed after going 2-0 down so quickly shows a team with a lot of character. Delighted Adam Idah scored a couple of great goals to boost his confidence. We made it too easy at times but Villa are a top team so we can hold our heads high.\nStephen:A great game to watch. Poor start, came back brilliantly to be level at half-time. Idah's performance and two goals were first class. Bayern or Real next round. Hopefully that will entice players to Celtic Park before transfer window closes.\nNeil:After five minutes I was having Dortmund flashbacks! We bounced back well. I have questioned Idah's desire, but great credit to him. His best performance in a Celtic shirt. We rode our luck in second half and didn't capitulate. Small individual errors at this level get ruthlessly punished. Overall, an excellent group-stage performance.\nSteven:Fair play we fought back brilliantly. But we were dreadful at the back and every attack was a possible goal for Villa. No confidence without Cameron Carter-Vickers. Madrid or Bayern could have been avoided!\nPatrick:Very poor defensively, but a solid performance from Idah kept us in the game for a while. A shame we didn't get a better result, but only our second loss in eight Champions League games is something to be proud of. Unfortunately I doubt we'll progress beyond the next round, so we need to build on this next season.\nMark:Celtic played well with depleted squad. Cracking tie to look forward to - either Bayern Munich or Real Madrid will be tough but we'll give it our best shot whoever it is.",

    "text": "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game atArsenal(kick-off 16:30 GMT).\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\nThe injury list \"continues the same\" so Guardiola does not expect any players to return for Sunday.\nOnfacing Real Madridin the Champions League play-offs: \"It feels like a derby already. Four years in a row facing Real Madrid. But Bayern or Madrid - both was really tough. Hopefully we can arrive for the first leg here, and then at Madrid, as best as possible.\"\nOn the difficulty of the Champions League draw: \"It's fine. We could have been better? Yeah. We could have been in the top eight? Yeah, but we were not good enough. We don't deserve to be in the finals this season, winning just three games and drawing another one. We lost a lot. The draw could have been nicer? Yes, but the draw is the draw. Bayern Munich was extremely difficult. Real Madrid difficult - we know that. We have done it in the past. It is not a problem.\"\nOn a congested fixture calendar in February, Guardiola said the \"schedule is what it is\" and that the \"Premier League always puts the toughest schedules for teams in Europe\".\nHe insisted that he was \"not complaining\" because it has \"always been like that\": \"I remember when I was in Barcelona, following the Premier League and Alex Ferguson, Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger made the same complaints. Do you think it is going to change? The broadcasters decide - they don't ask me.\"\nGuardiola is not sure if City will add any more players this window but said he is \"always happy\" with what the club do as they have done \"their best for now and [will do for] the next five, 10, 20 years. They always try to do their best\".\nOn the future of James McAtee: \"I don't think [we are selling]. He is going to stay. We don't have enough players. We have a World Cup at the end of the season [and] we have a lot of games. But maybe an offer will arrive and we will have to sell him.\"\nThe City boss rejected questions that Sunday's game is a grudge match, stating his relationship with Arsenal counterpart Mikel Arteta is still \"exceptional\" and \"the respect we have is always there\".\nOn whether Rodri picking up his injury against Arsenal in September was the turning point for City this season: \"The absence of Rodri is massive but it has not just been Rodri. The best player in the world absent - tell me one team in the world who would not notice? I'd have preferred to lose that game and have Rodri all season, but the situation we had this season was not just because of Rodri.\"\nFollow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news\nFull commentary of Arsenal v Manchester City from 16:30 GMT on Sunday on BBC Radio 5 Live",

    "title": "Trump offers incentives to federal workers to quit jobs",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "US President Donald Trump has offered federal workers the option to resign and receive pay for eight months, in a major effort to shrink and reform the US government.\nIn an email, his administration has asked almost all government employees to decide by 6 February whether they want to be part of a \"deferred resignation\" programme that will mean them leaving their jobs no later than the end of September.\nThose who received the email have voiced confusion about what the deal would mean in practice.\nThe website of the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) gives an outline of the plans, stating on an FAQs page that those who accept the deal are \"not expected to work\", except in rare cases.\nIt also says anyone who decides to quit will be exempt for the remainder of their contracts from Trump's requirement that they work in the office rather than at home.\nSenior Trump officials told US media that the plan could save the government up to $100bn (£80bn).\nDelivering the offer, a message from the OPM, the government's HR agency, highlighted planned reforms including a requirement that most employees work in their offices five days a week.\nSince returning to the White House last week, Trump has already declared the end of Covid-era home working practices.\nThe OPM said the offer was available to \"all full-time federal employees\" - excluding certain staff such as postal workers, members of the military, immigration officials, and some national security teams.\nWorkers wishing to take the deal were asked to reply to the email with the word \"resign\" in the subject line. The offer has been described as \"very generous\" by the White House.\nThe message also warned of future downsizing that could impact those who chose to stay. \"We cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity,\" it read.\nStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, told CNN that federal workers were \"overwhelmingly left of centre\", and that it was \"essential\" for Trump to \"get control of government\".\nThe move has been condemned. In a statement to US media, the head of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union warned that this \"purging\" process would have \"vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government\".\nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine was among those questioning Trump's power to make such deals. \"If you accept that offer and resign, he'll stiff you just like he stiffed contractors,\" he said. \"He doesn't have any authority to do this. Do not be fooled by this guy.\"\nThe returning US president repeatedly pledged to cut the size of the government and slash federal spending while on the campaign trail.\nHe tasked Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy with leading an advisory body focused on cutting regulations, spending, and headcounts within the federal government. Ramaswamy has since left this new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) to run for governor of Ohio.\nBut the email on Tuesday bore resemblance to one sent to employees of Twitter, now X, in late 2022 after Musk bought the social media platform. He asked for an emailed response if they wanted to remain at the company.\nAre you a US federal employee who has been offered an incentive package?Get in touch.\nThe mass offer came at the end of an at-times chaotic day in Washington, followinga memo Trump issued which said he would pause federal grants, loans and other assistance.\nA district judge suspended the order - which was initially set to go into effect on Tuesday afternoon - until next Monday.\nIn the hours before that decision, there was widespread confusion over which federal programmes and organisations would be impacted. The White House repeatedly sought to assuage concerns that Social Security payments and Medicaid access could be disrupted.\nIn a letter to the White House, top Democrats expressed \"extreme alarm\" about the plan to pause funding.\nAlso on Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at restricting young people's access to gender-related medical treatments.\nThe order, titled Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, says it would prevent those aged under 19 from making \"life-altering\" choices.\n\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another,\" the order said.\nIt is unclear how the order would be implemented and it is likely to be challenged in court.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter. Readers in the UK cansign up here. Those outside the UK cansign up here.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of responses.\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe president started his White House news conference as \"consoler-in-chief\" but then pivoted into unevidenced political blame, writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Norovirus cases in England are currently more than double the expected number for this time of year, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.\nSeparate data from NHS England showed 898 hospital beds were filled on average every day last week by patients suffering from norovirus-like symptoms - a 15% increase from last week.\nHigher case numbers are likely due to a number of factors, the agency has said, including \"the emergence of an unusual norovirus genotype\" and increased use of testing technology.\nProf Julian Redhead, NHS national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, called the rise a \"worrying surge\", and the UKHSA said there was a big impact on hospitals and care homes.\n\"Hospitals remain close to capacity, with almost a fifth of beds filled due to seasonal viruses and delayed discharges to settings like social and community care,\" Prof Redhead added.\nNHS England said pressure on hospital capacity remained high last week with an average of 96% adult beds occupied and a total of 97,567 patients in hospital each day.\nLaboratory reports only represent a small proportion of total norovirus cases, and it is estimated that for every case reported to national surveillance in the UK, about 288 in the community go unreported, an annual figure of around 3 million cases.\nNorovirus levels are also higher than the same period 12 months ago, when 688 hospital beds were filled with people experiencing diarrhoea and vomiting symptoms, and also January 2023, when 395 beds were used by those with symptoms.\nAccording to UKHSA, some of the higher numbers may be attributable to the use of PCR multiplex technology, which can detect multiple gastrointestinal pathogens in one test.\nBut it is likely that an unusual norovirus genotype emerging (GII. 17), along with changes in epidemiology following the coronavirus pandemic, are also contributing to the rise in cases.\nAt present, there is no indication that the genotype leads to more severe illness.\nNorovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea but a high temperature, abdominal pains and aching limbs are also common. The virus spreads easily, for example through close contact with someone infected or by eating food prepared by someone with it.\nThose infected with norovirus can also experience dehydration, which is especially common amongst vulnerable groups including young children and those with weakened immune systems.\nMost healthy people recover in a few days, but it can cause serious problems for those in vulnerable groups.\n\"It's really important that if you have diarrhoea and vomiting that you take steps to avoid passing the infection on,\" Amy Douglas, an epidemiologist at UKHSA said.\n\"Avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection in these settings\".\nMs Douglas advised those suffering to not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms end and do not prepare food for others in that time.\n\"This is because you can still pass on the virus in the days after you stop being sick.\"\nThe advice from UKHSA to avoid passing on norovirus is to wash your hands with soap and warm water and to use bleach-based products to clean surfaces, which will help to stop infections from spreading.\n\"Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus, so don't rely on those alone,\" Ms Douglas added.",

    "text": "Michael Cheika was appointed Leicester head coach in June 2024\nMichael Cheika will step down as Leicester Tigers head coach when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nThe 57-year-old took the job last summer on a one-year deal after being appointed just a week after fellow Australian Dan McKellar left by mutual consent.\nTigers, who are fourth in the Premiership table and have reached the last 16 of the European Champions Cup, are now looking for their ninth new head coach in less than nine years.\nIt was reported last weekthat Tigers are understood to have already spoken to celebrated former Leicester prop and ex-Munster head coach Graham Rowntree as a potential replacement.\nLeicester Tigers Rugby Show\nGloucester beat Tigers in Slater Cup thriller\n'I knew I was in so much pain' - Watson on retirement realisation\nConfirmation that former Australia and Argentina head coach Cheika will not stay at Mattioli Woods Welford Road comes a week after he saidTigers' heavy 80-12 defeat by Toulousein the Champions Cup had pushed back talks about his future.\nAt the time, he spoke about how a decade away from the week-to-week demands of club rugby, as well as the speed of the appointment, were among the reasons why he committed to only a year.\nTigers chief executive Andrea Pinchen has said Cheika's departure comes a blow, but not as a surprise.\n\"While disappointed, given the positive influence Michael has had since joining us in the summer, we were always aware of this being a one-year deal and we have been transparent with players, staff, and supporters on that point,\"Pinchen told the club website,external.\n\"As we have said throughout Michael's tenure, we would have liked to have extended his time in the head coach role but understand why that can't happen.\"\nCheika has Tigers fourth in the Premiership table, having overseen six league wins from 11 to date.\nAnd while he has also guided them into the knockout stage of Europe's biggest club competition, Tigers have also suffered record-breaking defeats during his tenure.\nThe loss against Toulouse was Leicester's heaviest in that competition, while they gave up a record amount of points at home in a Premiership gamewhen beaten 54-24 by Bristol Bearsin December.\nStill, with Tigers in contention for titles under the decorated head coach - who previously guided NSW Waratahs to Super Rugby success and Leinster to European glory in the Heineken Cup in 2009 – hopes remain high that his tenure in the East Midlands will prove memorable.\n\"It goes without saying that Michael is fully committed to seeing out his time as head coach in a successful way, determined to add silverware to the trophy cabinet at Mattioli Woods Welford Road, and we are excited about what remains in this campaign,\" Pinchen added.\nBBC Radio Leicester's Adam Whitty\nLeicester fans feared this may be the case as time progressed, and with a one-year deal this was always a possibility.\nCheika signed on last minute after Dan McKellar's dramatic exit last year, almost to help the club out, if anything. With his family back home in Australia, he couldn't be a family man there, and a professional sports coach in Leicester.\nTigers did well to get a coach of such pedigree at short notice, and Leicester have made improvements, particularly in their attack, but instability still reigns at Tigers.\nCheika's replacement will be their ninth head coach in nine years - they cannot succeed with churn like that.\nThe former Wallabies and Argentina head coach had started to expand Leicester's attack and style of play. With a new man in charge, with a new philosophy and style, Tigers can perhaps expect another transition season next year.",

If Bournemouth are in a position at the end of the season where they will play in Europe next year, then you would like to think he would want to stay unless a team came in and offered him a deal too good to turn down.\n\"He made the decision to come to Bournemouth as a 19-year-old and not wait for a bigger club even though people were saying very nice things about him so he wants to play.

    "text": "One of the things that makes Unai Emery such an interesting speaker on the game is the impression that, behind all the professional intensity his job requires, he is really in this for the same thing as you and me: for the thrills.\n\"The atmosphere was FAN-TAS-TIC,\" he said expressively in the press room last night, as his thoughts and emotions tumbled out.\nIt had been an especially vivid occasion, even by the standards of the past year or two. Fittingly, given Emery's urgings to his players and Villa's supporters to make the most of every moment of this Champions League campaign, their position was in question even after their game ended, extending the drama.\nNobody wanted to rush off anyway.\nIt was almost too much. To make sure he would always remember, Morgan Rogers – still a Championship player a year ago – cradled the match ball and his man-of-the-match trophy in one arm, while taking a selfie in front of the man-of-the-match sign. The photograph will be his keepsake of a year of exceptional progress.\nThe grand occasion was bookended by reminders of the colder realities of modern football. Some around the ground were put out before kick-off by reports ofArsenal'soffer for Ollie Watkins - not that the Gunners made it given Watkins' obvious ability, but more that it should become known just before such a significant game.\nWatkins did not play as if distracted. Yes, he might have scored far more than one, but his all-round centre-forward play was vital. Maybe Emery's comments on Arsenal's interest left open the possibility that he might move, but really he was only acknowledging that for every player, there is ultimately a deal too good to reject. But it would have to be a very big number.\nHe seemed resigned though, to Jhon Duran moving to Saudi Arabia: \"The players have the objective, the ambition. Sometimes they are impassioned. If he is leaving, it is because he prefers to do another way in his career.\"\nThe reported numbers probably make it good business for Villa, although Emery seemed to find the player's motivation hard to compute: \"I told you, I want him here. But what does he want?\"\nEmery did not speculate. But you could imagine Villa fans thinking of the delirious celebrations in the Holte End and wondering: \"Jhon, don't you want THAT?\"\nWolves v Aston Villa – live commentary on BBC Radio WM (95.6FM/DAB/Freeview 714), Saturday 17:30 GMT\nBBC Radio WM Football Phone-In – weeknights 18:00 GMT",

    "text": "Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft was the big winner at an awards ceremony celebrating accessibility in the gaming industry.\nThe French company, which has offices all over the world, was named Most Dedicated Publisher by GAConf.\nThe organisation works to make gaming more inclusive for people with disabilities - something companies have been focusing on more and more.\nThis year its awards show handed out prizes to games released in 2024 for features including those aimed at helping deaf and blind players.\nUbisoft was also recognised for two games it released last year.\nStar Wars Outlaws won the AAA Excellence award - for a big-budget title - for itslong list of accessibility features.\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown - a 2D platformer released last January - was recognised for its \"memory shards\" feature.\nThe game requires players to navigate a large, complex map, often revisiting areas much later on in their playthrough.\nMany titles in the genre allow a user to place small pins - or icons - as reminders of points of interest, but The Lost Crown lets them take a screenshot to aid their memory.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 also won an award for its automatic movement features, and Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred won for its blind and low vision accessibility.\nGAConf also honours individuals in the games industry for their accessibility work.\nCari Watterton, who works for Sniper Elite developer Rebellion, won the MVP Award for Unsung Hero.\nSpeaking to BBC Newsbeat before her win, the senior accessibility designer said being recognised by others who work in her field \"hits a little bit differently\".\n\"They understand the amount of work that goes into accessibility and the challenges that you face,\" she said.\nNewsbeat previously spoke to Cari about her work on accessibility in 2023.\nAt the time she said it had been a really great year in the space and more companies were looking to recruit specialists.\nShe says the progress could have looked \"slower\" over the past 12 months, but games take time to make and developers are working on new things.\n\"The important thing is that we are seeing something new, in hardware, features, in games adopting their first accessibility features,\" says Cari.\n\"And we're seeing the quality of these features improve as well, which is fantastic.\"\nCari's currently working on Atomfall - due for release in March - which took the rare step ofannouncing its accessibility featureswhen the game was first revealed.\nGAConf co-director Ian Hamilton told BBC Newsbeat that \"whittling down the longlist into the finalists for each category was by far the hardest yet\" in the history of the ceremony.\nIan, who's worked in the accessibility field since 2006, says the \"landscape is really unrecognisable compared to even just five years ago, let alone ten\".\nHe said awareness of different players' needs and the number of specialist roles in the games industry had vastly increased, and a number of mainstream game awards now have an accessibility category.\nHe said a dedicated ceremony allows the organisers to celebrate progress across the industry, giving awards in areas including advocacy, journalism and specialist resources.\n\"But there's still a long way to go,\" he said.\n\"And we're a very long way off from where we really need to be - where anyone can pick up any game and have a reasonable expectation that they won't be unnecessarily locked out.\"\nThe games industry's troubles in 2024, including studio closures and layoffs, have been widely reported.\nDragon Age: The Veilguard maker Bioware - which won an award at GAConf for best representation - announced a studio restructuring just after the ceremony.\nIt said some staff had been moved elsewhere, and though its post didn't mention job losses Newsbeat understands that about 20 people were laid off.\nAnd Ubisoft's accessibility wins come just days after it announced the closure of its Leamington Spa studio and staff reductions at other international offices, totalling 185 job losses.\nLate last year the company also said ithad disbanded the team behind award winner The Lost Crownafter reports suggested it did not hit sales targets.\nThe publisher, which employs 18,500 people worldwide, has alsodelayed the upcoming game in its flagship Assassin's Creed series twice.\nBut they are far from the only company affected.\nCari says the impact has been felt across all areas of the industry, but she hopes developers will continue to push forward on accessibility.\n\"I don't think accessibility will be singled out,\" she says.\n\"I think it's going to be part of it. Something that we're all going to have to go through together.\n\"It's a shame, but I know that so much has been proven with reaching more people.\"\nGAConf co-director Ian said the current climate had affected accessibility efforts, with dedicated roles cut and the scale of job losses meaning wider expertise has been lost.\nHowever, he said that new positions were also being created and some teams were getting bigger.\n\"In terms of dedicated headcount we're in a relatively stable place compared to the wider industry,\" Ian said.\n\"Which I think is a strong statement about how much accessibility is now valued.\"\nAAA Excellence - Star Wars Outlaws\nIndie Excellence - Another Crab's Treasure\nBest Deaf & Hard of Hearing Accessibility - Star Wars Outlaws\nBest Physical & Mobility Accessibility - Call of Duty: Black Ops 6\nBest Blind & Low Vision Accessibility - Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred\nBest Cognitive Accessibility - Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown\nBest Mental Health Accessibility - Life Is Strange: Double Exposure\nBest Representation - Dragon Age: The Veilguard\nBest Journalism -A Prominent Accessibility Advocate Never Actually Existed, by Grant Stoner\nBest Academic Research - Surveyor\nBest Assistive Technology - ByoWave Proteus\nBest Accessibility Resource - Game Accessibility Workshop Toolkit\nBest Comms & Marketing - Access-Ability Summer Showcase\nMost Improved - Diablo IV\nGreatest Accessibility Innovation - Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown\nMost Dedicated Publisher - Ubisoft\nMost Dedicated Studio - Ubisoft Kyiv\nThe Advocacy Award - Matthew \"TheWobblyGamer\" Allcock\nListen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere.\nA Belfast based choir is one of four shortlisted for a prestigious UK award.\nAn outdoor charity, Change of Scene, says its earmarked site turned out to be a shooting ground.\nMost of a £20m fund to move people with learning disabilities out of institutional care has not been spent, a report says.\nPlayers with learning disabilities like Bernardo have been practising with Jersey Futsal.\nThe majority of a £20m fund remains unspent, according to a new report.",

    "title": "Heathrow third runway: What's the plan for expanding the airport?",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.\nThe move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.\nCritics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.\nHowever, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".\nHeathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.\nA third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.\nThe number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.\nHeathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.\nThe airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.\nBut after years of wrangling overthe original plans, the initial cost estimate of £14bn will need to be revised.\nEven with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.\nAny planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.\nLocal authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.\nAfter all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.\nReeves has told the BBCshe wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.\nA third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.\nSeveral members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.\nBut Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"\nHowever, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.\nHeathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.\nSome arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.\nOther European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.\nCurrently, over £200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.\nThe Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion andreported in 2015that there would be benefits to the tune of £61bn over 60 years.\nIt said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.\nForging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.\nHowever, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundationsay the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.\nAviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.\nReeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.\nButit is far from clearthat those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.\nLast year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.\nFriends of the Earth has described the plan for a third runway as \"hugely irresponsible\".\nAlethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible, said: \"This huge increase in emissions won't help our economy, and would just encourage the small group of frequent flyers who take most of the flights.\"\nPlans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.\nWork is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.\nThe government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.\nGatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to previously published plans. Pre-covid, its record was 47 million.\nMeanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.\nIn total these expansions could create capacity for more than 60 million extra passengers by the 2040s.\nThe 3.8% increase means an anytime return ticket between Glasgow and Edinburgh will rise by £1.20.\nThe chancellor announces projects in England's south as infrastructure in the North East crumbles.\nThe airline says it follows feedback about which European destinations islanders wanted.\nIn choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some tricky navigation - and it will make big domestic political waves too\nThe UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",

    "text": "Australia's science minister, Ed Husic, has become the first member of a Western government to raise privacy concerns about DeepSeek, the Chinese chatbot causing turmoil on the markets and in the tech industry.\nChinese tech, from Huawei to TikTok, has repeatedly been the subject of allegations the firms are linked to the Chinese state, and fears this could lead to peoples' data being harvested for intelligence purposes.\nDonald Trump has said DeepSeekis a \"wake up call\"for the US but did not seem to suggest it was a threat to national security - instead saying it could even be a good thing if it brought costs down.\nBut Husic told ABC News on Tuesday there remained a lot of unanswered questions, including over \"data and privacy management.\"\n\"I would be very careful about that, these type of issues need to be weighed up carefully,\" he added.\nDeepSeek has not responded to the BBC's request for comment - but users in the UK and US have so far shown no such caution.\nDeepSeek has rocketed to the top of the app stores in both countries, with market analysts Sensor Tower saying it has seen 3 million downloads since launch.\nAs much as 80% of these have come in the past week - meaning it has been downloaded at three times the rate of rivals such as Perplexity.\nMeanwhile, US officials have raised questions about national security, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\"I spoke with [the National Security Council] this morning, they are looking into what [the national security implications] may be,\" she said.\nAnd the US navy has reportedly banned its members from using DeepSeek's apps altogether, citing \"potential security and ethical concerns\", according to CNBC.\nThe Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.\nAccording to DeepSeek'sown privacy policy, it collects large amounts of personal information collected from users, which is then stored \"in secure servers\" in China.\nThis may include:\nIt says it uses this information to improve DeepSeek by enhancing its \"safety, security and stability\".\nIt will then share this information with others, such as service providers, advertising partners, and its corporate group, which will be kept \"for as long as necessary\".\n\"There are genuine concerns around the technological potential of DeepSeek, specifically around the terms of its privacy policy,\" said ExpressVPN's digital privacy advocate Lauren Hendry Parsons.\nShe specifically highlighted the part of the policy which says data can be used \"to help match you and your actions outside of the service\" - which she said \"should immediately ring an alarm bell for anyone concerned with their privacy\".\nBut while the app harvests a lot of data, experts point out it's very similar to privacy policies users may have already agreed to for rival services like ChatGPT and Gemini, or even social media platforms.\n\"For any openly available AI model, with a web or app interface - including but not limited to DeepSeek - the prompts, or questions that are asked of the AI, then become available to the makers of that model, as are the answers,\" said Emily Taylor, chief executive of Oxford Information Labs\n\"So, anyone working on confidential or national security areas needs to be aware of those risks,\" she told the BBC.\nDr Richard Whittle from University of Salford said he had \"various concerns about data and privacy\" with the app, but said there were \"plenty of concerns\" with the models used in the US too.\n\"Consumers should always be wary, especially in the hype and fear of missing out on a new, highly popular, app,\" he said.\nThe UK data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office has urged the publicto be aware of their rightsaround their information being used to train AI models.\nAsked by BBC News if it shared the Australian government's concerns, it said in a statement: \"Generative AI developers and deployers need to make sure people have meaningful, concise and easily accessible information about the use of their personal data and have clear and effective processes for enabling people to exercise their information rights.\n\"We will continue to engage with stakeholders on promoting effective transparency measures, without shying away from taking action when our regulatory expectations are ignored.\"",

    "text": "Villagers are calling on a council to rethink its decision to scrap plans for a long-awaited bypass, after highways bosses removed it from their transport plan.\nFor years, residents of Farthinghoe in Northamptonshire have campaigned for relief from the A422 traffic that congests the village, arguing it is not only a nuisance but a danger to life.\nThis month, Conservative-run West Northamptonshire Council announceda bypass would not be included in its Local Transport Plan (LTP)- a document outlining transport priorities for the next 20 years - because of a \"low economic case\".\nWendy Hancock, who lives on the main road, described the traffic as \"complete chaos\".\n\"My front door is actually bricked up on the inside because you can't use it – it would be too dangerous,\" she told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.\nParish councillor John Grant added that \"you take your life in your hands\" when walking around one of the main bends through the village.\nHe said \"nobody with a pram would dare walk down there\".\nThe council had been working on preliminary designs for the bypass since 2020, with cost estimates for the road between £28.5m and £33.75m.\nHowever, it has since stated it would not be delivered before 2045 and has instead proposed a traffic mitigation scheme.\nMick Morris, the parish council chairman, criticised the local authority for failing to follow up on a promised weight restriction study.\n\"Are these the actions of a professional and responsible council? I think not,\" he said.\nSouth Northamptonshire MP Sarah Bool, Conservative, acknowledged residents' disappointment and urged all parties to work together on a solution.\nWest Northamptonshire Council said alternative traffic solutions, including weight limits, would be explored at an upcoming public engagement event.\nFollow Northamptonshire news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.\nThe local authority says the area has been \"neatly restored\".\nThe chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.\nThe chancellor's pledge to speed up the building of a railway station prompts worries for residents.\nA council's approved draft budget includes £11m for the planned Watlington relief road.\nThe route will be shut for two weekends in February and March with diversions in place.",

    "title": "Sara Sharif family court judges named after appeal",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Three judges who oversaw Family Court hearings involving Sara Sharif in the years before she was murdered can be named for the first time following a legal appeal.\nSara's father Urfan Sharif, 43, and stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, have been jailed for life for her murder in Woking, Surrey in 2023.\nFollowing their convictions, the media were able to publish details from previous Family Court hearings relating to Sara's care before her death.\nHowever, a High Court ruling prevented the media from naming the three judges involved in the case, Judge Alison Raeside - who sat on most of the hearings - Judge Peter Nathan and Judge Sally Williams.\nMr Justice Williams, who made the High Court order, said there had been a \"real risk\" of harm to the judges from a \"virtual lynch mob\".\nMedia organisations, including the BBC, successfully appealed, arguing that judges must expect \"their decision-making to be the subject of public scrutiny\".\nThe most senior civil judge in England and Wales, Sir Geoffrey Vos, Master of the Rolls, found in favour of the media saying \"the whole idea of anonymising the judge was, I have to say, misguided\".\nNow the judges can be named, we can report that Judge Alison Raeside sat on the earliest hearings involving Sara, the last one, and most of the hearings in between.\nThe court was involved with the family before Sara was even born, and the first time her name is mentioned was on 17 January 2013. She was six days old.\nSurrey County Council was seeking an interim care order - it wanted Sara and two of her siblings to be temporarily taken into foster care until a final decision was made.\nThe hearing was before Judge Raeside, sitting as a family judge at Guildford County Court.\nShe was told there were concerns that Sara and her siblings were \"not adequately supervised\", and that two of them had \"unexplained injuries\".\nThe judge was also told that Urfan Sharif had subjected Sara's mother Olga Sharif to domestic abuse.\nSocial workers had asked for the children to be taken into care. They said concerns about the family dated back to May 2010 - almost three years before Sara was born - when one of the siblings had been found alone in a local shop.\nJudge Raeside heard that as far back as November 2010, there had been allegations that Urfan Sharif had beaten Olga Sharif and Sara's older siblings, though she decided not to press charges. Police had then been called to the home on three occasions in 2011 and 2012 after complaints of further domestic abuse.\nJudge Raeside decided against a care order and made an interim supervision order instead, saying that Sara and her siblings could stay with their parents under the supervision of Surrey County Council Children's Services while further assessments were prepared.\nThe final hearing was delayed to 19 September 2013 and on that day Judge Raeside again decided the children should stay with their parents under supervision. By this time social workers had changed their recommendation to a \"supervision order\".\nJust over a year later, in November 2014, the case was back before the Family Court after one of Sara's siblings said Olga had bitten them.\nOlga Sharif had been charged with assault and Surrey council made an urgent application for the children to be taken into foster care.\nThe emergency hearing was heard by Judge Peter Nathan, but the next day the case was before Judge Raeside again.\nShe decided that Sara and one of her siblings could return to live with Urfan Sharif.  The sibling who had been bitten was placed into foster care.\nAt a hearing the following year, Judge Raeside was told that Surrey council was still extremely concerned at the risk of harm to Sara.\nOne of her siblings had said that Urfan Sharif had punched them and slapped them with a belt on the bottom.\nOn the second day of the three-day hearing Olga Sharif announced she was separating from Urfan Sharif because of domestic violence.\nShe said that in the past Urfan Sharif had poured a flammable liquid on her and tried to set it alight.\nOn other occasions she said Urfan Sharif had held a knife to her throat and tried to strangle her with a belt. She said home life with Urfan Sharif was like living in a prison. She moved into a women's refuge and the children moved with her.\nIn July 2015, another judge, Judge Sally Williams, had Sara and her sibling taken into temporary foster care after reports that Urfan Sharif had been secretly seeing them while they were still at the refuge.\nThat September, Judge Raeside agreed an interim care order that meant Sara and her sibling stayed for a while in foster care. But in November, she ordered that the children could live with their mother Olga Sharif, with Urfan Sharif getting supervised access.\nFor the next few years the family courts were not involved with the family, and on 1 February 2019 Judge Raeside was promoted. She was appointed as the designated family judge for Surrey. But a few months after that the family were back in front of her again.\nBy now Urfan Sharif had a new wife Beinash Batool. He was asking the court to sanction arrangements for Sara and her sibling to live with them with Olga Sharif getting some supervised contact. The court was told Olga Sharif had already agreed to this.\nJudge Raeside heard that Sara and her sibling had complained that Olga had mistreated them, and they had already started living with their father and stepmother. Sara had apparently said her mother had slapped her and pulled her hair, and had tried to burn her with a lighter and drown her in the bath. It had been Urfan Sharif who first raised the allegations.\nA social worker who was asked to prepare a report for the court also recommended that Sara and her sibling should live with their father and step-mother with supervised contact with Olga Sharif.\nOn 9 July 2019, Judge Raeside, who by now had been involved in hearings involving the family for more than six and a half years, agreed that Sara and her sibling should live with their father Urfan Sharif and stepmother Beinash Batool - the two people who would kill her five years later -  \"it is ordered that the children do live with the father and Ms Batool\", she said.\nThey were both convicted in December 2024 of murdering Sara Sharif.\nThe judge who ordered the anonymity of the judges said that if anything it was the system rather than individuals that should be held up to public scrutiny.\nIn a judgment Mr Justice Williams said: \"In this case the evidence suggests that social workers, guardians, lawyers and judiciary acted within the parameters that law and social work practice set for them.\n\"Certainly to my reasonably well-trained eye there is nothing (save the benefit of hindsight) which indicates that the decisions reached in 2013, 2015 or 2019 were unusual or unexpected.\"\n\"Based on what was known at the time and applying the law at the time I don't see the judge or anyone else having any real alternative option.\"\nThe lawyer acting for newspapers and broadcasters including the BBC, Adam Wolanski KC said judges were \"the face of justice itself\" and must expect \"their decision-making to be the subject of public scrutiny.\"\nOn Friday, the highest ranking judge in England and Wales announced the formation of a \"security taskforce\" to assess how to better protect the safety of judges.\nIn a letter seen by the PA news agency, Chief Justice Baroness Carr said that incidents were \"becoming all too common\", and she was \"increasingly concerned\" about threats made to judges on social media.\nThe naming of the judges comes just days afternew rules came in permitting reporting from family courts in England and Wales.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Singer and actress Marianne Faithfull has died at the age of 78, her spokesperson has said.\nBorn in Hampstead in December 1946, she was known for hits like As Tears Go By, which reached the UK top 10 in 1964, and for starring roles in films including 1968's The Girl On A Motorcycle.\nShe was also famously the girlfriend of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in the 1960s, inspiring songs such as Wild Horses and You Can't Always Get What You Want. After a period of heroin addiction in the 70s, she resurrected her career with the classic album Broken English.\nPaying tribute, Jagger described Faithfull as \"a wonderful friend, a beautiful singer and a great actress,\" saying he was \"so saddened\".\nHis bandmate Keith Richards posted that he was \"so sad\" following Faithfull's death, adding that he \"will miss her\".\nRolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood posted twice on Instagram. One an old picture of him, Faithfull and Richards in a recording studio with the caption \"Farewell dear Marianne\", and a more recent shot of the pair with the words \"Marianne will be dearly missed. Bless her xx\".\n\"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family,\" a statement from her spokesperson said.\n\"She will be dearly missed.\"\nThe singer had previously suffered multiple health problems, including bulimia, breast cancer and emphysema caused by decades of smoking.\nIn 2020, she contracted Covid-19 and was hospitalised for 22 days.\nDoctors said they did not expect her to survive - but she pulled through, releasing her 21st album, She Walks in Beauty, a year later.\nHer story is a remarkable portrait of the rock and roll era.\nShe was a doe-eyed poster girl of the 1960s, plucked from obscurity by the Rolling Stones' manager at the age of 16 and given As Tears Go By, the first song ever written by Jagger and Keith Richards.\nAn international hit, her version was light and breathy, delivered in a folk-pop style that was to become her trademark during the swinging 60s.\nWith her eponymous debut album and 1966's North Country Maid, she became part of the \"British Invasion\" of the US pop charts.\nMeanwhile, her affair with Jagger turned her into a tabloid lightning rod. After they split she fell into drug addiction - at one point living homeless on the streets of Soho.\nShe re-emerged tentatively with the 1976 album Dreamin' My Dreams but really hit her stride with 1979's New Wave-influenced Broken English, on which she showcased the ashen voice and hard-won wisdom that would define the second act of her career. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award.\nIn recent years, she teamed up with songwriters like PJ Harvey and Nick Cave, who each cited her as an inspiration.\nOther collaborators over the years included David Bowie, Lou Reed, Jarvis Cocker, Damon Albarn, Emmylou Harris and Metallica, whose drummer Lars Ulrich thanked Faithfull for her \"incredible and unique contribution to our music, and for always being so willing to join us in performing it\".\nHer acting career ran in parallel to music. On stage, she appeared alongside Glenda Jackson in Chekhov's Three Sisters; and played Ophelia in Hamlet – later admitting her nightly descent into madness had been chemically enhanced.\nShe also played God in two episodes of the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, and the devil in William Burroughs' and Tom Waits' musical, The Black Rider.\nBut music was where her heart lay. Her penultimate album, 2018's Negative Capabilty, was a meditation on ageing, loneliness and grief – inspired partly by the death of her old friend, and fellow Rolling Stones' paramour Anita Pallenberg; and partly by the terror attacks on the Bataclan nightclub in her adopted home of Paris.\nTaking her full circle, the album included a raw and emotional re-recording of As Tears Go By that reduced everyone in the studio to tears, according to producer Rob Ellis.\nFaithfull received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Women's World Awards, and was made a commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the government of France.\nFaithfull's long-time friend, the BBC Radio 2 presenter Bob Harris, called her an \"encapsulation of the sixties\".\nHe said while she initially was known for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend, through her \"people began to see her as an artist, as a creator\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, Harris added: \"To me, she was wonderful, she was interesting, very, very bright, and from an aristocratic background, which was always part of the way she carried herself.\"\nThe singer married and divorced three times - to artist John Dunbar in 1965, Ben Brierly of punk band the Vibrators in 1979, and actor Giorgio Della Terza in 1988.\nShe is survived by her son, Nicholas Dunbar.",

    "text": "US President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on the US central bank, hours after officials left interest rates unchanged despite his public calls for them to cut.\nIn a social media post, he accused the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell of mishandling the economy, saying they had \"failed to stop the problem they created with Inflation\".\nThe Fed left key interest rate unchanged at its January meeting on Wednesday, in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, hitting pause after a string of cuts late last year.\nPowell said the bank was not \"in a hurry\" to cut more, given significant uncertainty about where the economy might be headed.\nTrump has promised significant changes to the US economy, with calls for sweeping tariffs, mass deportation of illegal migrants, and big cuts to taxes and regulations.\nSome economists have warned that some of those policies could put upward pressure on prices, at least in the short-term, concerns Powell said were shared by some at the bank.\nHoward Lutnick, Trump's pick to lead the Commerce Department, defended plans for tariffs and dismissed concerns about the impact on prices at his nomination hearing on Thursday.\nBut Powell said officials still had little sense of how those plans would shake out.\n\"The committee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what will happen,\" he said at a press conference to discuss the interest rate decision.\nThe Fed hiked borrowing costs significantly starting in 2022 in an effort to stabilise prices, which were then rising at a pace not seen in decades.\nInflation, the rate of price increases, has since fallen to 2.9% as of December, but remains above the bank's 2% target.\nTrump's campaign promises included calls for lower interest rates, which would bring relief to borrowers.\nIt has sparked debate about whether he will respect the tradition of Fed independence, which is meant to keep it focused on the long term health of the US economy and insulated from politics.\nPowell told reporters that he had had \"no contact\" with Trump and the bank was focused on the data in setting rates.\nBut questions Powell faced about how the Fed is handling a new order from the White House to cancel diversity programmes - and why it had withdrawn from a global group of central banks focused on the risks of climate change to the financial system - underscored the challenges he will face keeping the bank above the political fray.\nHe said the Fed was reviewing the president's order and said the group's focus had expanded into areas too distant from the Fed's.\n\"I'm aware of how it can look but it really was not driven by politics,\" he said.\nIn choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some tricky navigation - and it will make big domestic political waves too\nThe cost of living in Jersey is still rising but not as quickly as before, inflation figures show.\nLow-income families are being priced out of being able to afford to eat healthily, a charity warns.\nGuernsey's inflation statistics are published quarterly by the government's data and analysis team.\nWage growth increased by 3.4% after taking into account inflation, driven by strong increases in the private sector.",

    "text": "\"It's his presence and the way people talk about him. He lives in our imagination as much as he does in reality.\"\nThat's how Leeds Playhouse artistic director James Brining eulogises former Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa and how the Argentine affected the club and the city.\n\"He had an aura about him that I do not see in any other football manager. He has a different quality.\"\nBielsa has been gone from Elland Road for almost three years. His body of work and other-worldly way, you feel, will resonate forever around these parts.\nBrining wants to make sure it is remembered and reinvigorated in his new production being premiered in Leeds this June - Through It All Together.\nThe play, written by Chris O'Connor, is about a fictional couple, Howard and Sue, massive Leeds fans, one of whom is living with dementia.\nListen to Adam Pope's full interview with Brining and O'Connor here\n\"I'm trying to reflect the city and how many different aspects of that city went on a journey during Bielsa's era,\" explains O'Connor, an avid Leeds fan himself.\n\"I'm always unsure how football translates on stage. It's hard to do well and I've also wanted to write something about dementia. I have a close family member who lives with it.\"\nFor Brining, Bielsa's influence was omnipresent: \"What he is and was is something beyond that (football). What he did was about reframing what a club could be in relation to its fans and its city.\n\"He demonstrated that fairly modest Championship players could play in the Premier League and excel because of belief, teamwork, the values he instilled in them and the culture that he created.\"\nAfter the premiere in Leeds this summer, ideally after another promotion, the duo have high hopes to see the play go on tour.\n\"First and foremost you want to write entertaining stories,\" adds O'Connor. \"But I'd like some people to maybe feel differently about dementia. And I'd like people to relive memories we all had when Leeds got promoted.\"\nAs for Bielsa himself, Brining says they will reach out and let him know he has inspired the play. Brining missed Bielsa when he visited the Playhouse with his family during his tenure at the club.\nShortly afterwards he wrote to the artistic director to say how much he enjoyed the experience: \"The theatre is important for people's souls. I love what you are doing and together we are doing the same sort of thing.\"\nIn his own humble way I think he will approve from the wings with a \"Very good, Brining!\"\nThrough It All Together runs at the Leeds Playhouse from 23 June to 19 July.\nListen toWest Yorkshire Sport Daily, weeknights at 18:00, and subscribe to BBC Radio Leeds'Don't Go To Bed Just Yet podcast on BBC Sounds.",

    "text": "Arsenal made an approach for England striker Ollie Watkins on Monday\nStriker Ollie Watkins has told boss Unai Emery he wants to stay at Aston Villa and reject interest from Arsenal.\nThe Gunnersmade an approach for the England international on Mondaybut it was knocked back as Villa have no intention of letting the forward leave.\nEmery said Watkins, who scored in Wednesday's 4-2 Champions League win over Celtic, is expected to stay.\n\"Yes, he is happy to stay,\" he said, when asked if Watkins had expressed his desire to remain at Villa Park.\n\"You can ask him, but we asked him how he is feeling every day, every year he has been here with Aston Villa, with us and without us.\"\nWatkins, 29, has 81 goals in 201 appearances for Villa since joining from Brentford for £28m in 2020.\n\"The commitment of Ollie Watkins with us is a huge commitment. He appreciates a lot how Aston Villa was always supporting him, helping him, and when we [the current coaching staff] joined him here two years ago, how we worked with him, always trying to get the best of him.\n\"Now we need him, like he needed Aston Villa. The conversation we are having usually, I am speaking with him a lot, he is always adapting of every circumstance we have in the squad and individually with him.\n\"When there are some teams calling us being interested in the players, of course it is very good for us and very good for the players.\n\"Some players prefer to leave and some players accept to stay here, to be here and commit with us here and to be with our challenge. One of those is Ollie Watkins.\"\nFellow striker Jhon Duran is expected to complete a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in a deal worth up to 85m euros (£71.09m). The Saudi transfer window closes on Friday.\nMonchi, Villa's president of football operations, admits the club will need to keep some of the money brought in to help comply with profit and sustainability rules.\nHe said: \"It is an important operation for a player with tremendous potential.\n\"But these types of offers, for the club and the player, are difficult to reject. Between fixed and variable amounts, it will be close to 85m euros.\n\"There are a few small details left and for the player it is an incredible economic leap.\n\"The first thing we are going to do with the money we receive from the sale of Duran is to keep a portion of it because of the fair play rules, which are very demanding.\n\"A significant part of the income will go towards that.\"\nChelsea striker Joao Felix and Paris St-Germain forward Marco Asensio are on the Villa's wishlist before Monday's 23:00 GMT deadline as they look for reinforcements.\nFelix has seven goals in 20 games for Chelsea having moved to Stamford Bridge from Atletico Madrid for £45m in the summer but has made just three Premier League starts.\nSpain international Asensio, 29, has made 16 appearances for PSG, scoring twice, but just eight of them have come in Ligue 1 for the leaders.\nMonchi told Spanish radio station El Larguero: \"Then there are names, one of them being Joao. Emery likes him, because in the three transfer markets I have been in, the fourth with this one, he has always been mentioned and has been a small object of desire for Emery.\n\"But it is complicated, and I don't know if we will be able to be there.\n\"The first time, Aston Villa were in the Conference [League] and he wanted the Champions League - that's why he went to Barcelona. Then, in the operation with [Conor] Gallagher and Atletico he had to enter into negotiations with Chelsea and we couldn't get in.\n\"It's a similar case to Asensio there is also an important love affair. Shortly before my arrival, Aston Villa tried to sign him and came close, but he went to PSG.\n\"He is a player that Emery has always had in mind because he believes in his quality.\"",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Kash Patel, a one-time aide to President Donald Trump, will inch closer to leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) when he sits for his US Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday.\nPatel, a former Department of Defence (DoD) chief of staff, is a fervent Trump supporter and a fellow critic of the US government's top law enforcement agency.\nHe has previously suggested dramatically limiting the FBI's authority, which Republicans believe has unfairly targeted conservatives in recent years. The FBI's outgoing director Christopher Wray has denied such allegations.\nCritics say Patel is unqualified to lead the agency and wants to use the job to effect partisan retribution on critics of Trump.\nThe FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries.\nThe confirmation hearing will see Patel questioned by senators from across the political divide.\nDemocrats are likely to focus on Patel's previous attacks on the FBI, as well as his professional experience and past track record at the hearing.\nKnowledgeable sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, earlier this week that Democratic senators would seek to show that Patel had engaged in a pattern of poor judgment and self-aggrandisement, to cast doubt on his fitness to lead the FBI.\nIn recent days, Democrat Dick Durbin, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,released a lettersaying Patel was \"unfit to lead\" the agency.\nCiting an unnamed source, Durbin accused Patel of leaking news of an exchange of American hostages held by Houthis in Yemen in October 2020 to the Wall Street Journal \"several hours before the hostages were in confirmed custody of the United States\" - potentially endangering the deal.\nA source close to Patel spoke of his achievements in a statement to CBS. \"Mr Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor, and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe,\" they said.\n\"He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the court room to congressional hearing room to the situation room,\" the statement added. \"There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"\nAlex Gray, former chief of staff for the National Security Council (NSC) during the first Trump administration, further rebuffed Durbin's letter in his own statement to CBS, calling the source's statements \"simply absurd\".\n\"In everything he did at the NSC and DoD, Kash put the interests of the American people, and particularly the interests of American hostages and unlawful detainees and their families, first.\"\nPatel is also likely to be questioned on his previous comments about the FBI - the leadership of which he has strongly criticised in the past.\nIn his memoir Government Gangster, published in 2023, Patel called for an eradication of what he called \"government tyranny\" within the FBI by firing \"the top ranks\".\nSince his appointment, he has made headlines for his so-called enemies list - a list of people in his book appendix who he says are members of the \"deep-state\".\nThe 60-name roster includes former President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Merrick Garland and former National Security Adviser John Bolton, among others.\nSome Americans believe the \"deep state\", of which Patel is critical, is a synonym for an unelected bureaucratic machine that secretly runs the country for sinister purposes.\nAttorney general nominee Pam Bondi, who would be Patel's boss if both are confirmed by the Senate, told lawmakers during her confirmation hearing earlier this month that there would be no enemies list at the Department of Justice (DoJ) under her leadership.\nPatel, the son of Indian immigrants, is a former defence lawyer and federal prosecutor. He caught the attention of Trump - who was then serving his first time as president - after becoming a senior counsel to the House of Representatives intelligence committee in 2017.\nHe quickly rose within Trump's circle after he was hired as a national security aide in 2019, and in 2020 was appointed chief of staff to the head of the Pentagon.\nAs well as his 2023 memoir, Patel has published two pro-Trump children's books.\nHe is on the board of Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. He has also reportedly had a consulting contract with the company.\nAfter announcing Patel as his FBI pick, Trump posted on social media calling him \"an advocate for truth, accountability, and the constitution\".\n\"Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people,\" Trump said.\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe concert, which also featured Dr Dre and Pink, took place to help raise funds to rebuild the LA area.\nThe collision between a passenger plane and a military helicopter is suspected to have killed all 67 onboard.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Welsh ministers have been accused of shrugging off responsibility and waving a \"white flag\" over major cuts at Cardiff University.\nThe institution has announced plans to cut 400 full-time jobs amid a funding shortfall, with proposals including course closures and department mergers.\nOn Wednesday Conservative and Plaid Cymru politicians accused ministers of presiding over \"educational vandalism\" and \"stagnation\" in Welsh universities.\nHigher Education Minister Vikki Howells said the Welsh government, which oversees the sector, is doing all it can.\nShe said she was \"disappointed\" by Cardiff's move but blamed the previous Conservative government at Westminster for issues such as Brexit and \"rampant inflation\" for causing the funding problems facing the sector.\nIn the current academic year Welsh government funding for Cardiff University was cut by £3.6m - or 5.2%. Howells says 90% of funding for universities comes from outside of government.\nHowells was brought to the chamber to answer questions on the matter after the Senedd approved a topical question from Labour MS Julie Morgan.\nMorgan said she was\"particularly concerned that nursing is to be one of the main departments that will be affected\".\n\"According to the Royal College of Nursing, there are 800 to 1,000 students in the nursing school.\n\"To cut this number of nursing students, when it's estimated that we are short of 2,000 nurses in Wales, I can only say is astonishing, and the impact of this will be felt right across Wales.\"\nConservative education spokesperson Natasha Asghar said her phone had been \"bombarded by parents who are concerned about the future of their children at Cardiff University\".\nIt was disappointing, she said, \"to hear a Welsh government spokesperson shrug off any responsibility yesterday by saying that universities are independent institutions\".\n\"Is the government genuinely comfortable sitting on their hands and allowing this act of educational vandalism to be taking place,\" she said.\nPlaid Cymru education spokesman Cefin Campbell said Welsh universities \"are on the brink\".\nHe said the Tony Blair mantra of education, education, education had been replaced by \"stagnation, obfuscation and deterioration\".\n\"Despite the countless warnings about the financial sustainability of the sector, rather than providing crucial support, you are waving the white flag in the face of hundreds of redundancies.\"\nHe said the government had left the university sector to wither on the vine, and said Howells had prematurely announced a transformation fund \"only for that to turn out to be just smoke and mirrors\".\nHowells had been forced to clarify comments she made in the Senedd about such a fund last October, saying it was an a \"very exploratory stage\".\nOn Wednesday Howells said it had been decided that a transformation fund was \"not required at this stage\", and instead the government decided to increase tuition fees.\n\"I'm confident that the Welsh government is supporting the sector as much as we possibly can,\" she said.\nShe said the Welsh government had received the \"best funding settlement\" since the start of devolution from the UK Labour government, but said it could only \"begin to scrape the surface of the problems that we are facing\".\nThe minister, who said she was informed last week about Cardiff University's plans, said she recognised uncertainty was going to cause \"anxiety for many staff and students\".\nHowells said issues had been \"brought upon us by the previous UK government\" - blaming the \"hostile environment for those coming into our country from overseas\" as a result of visa changes.\nUniversities in Wales had been telling the government about declining international enrolments, she said.\nShe said she was \"disappointed\" that nursing courses formed part of the proposals, and said the Health Secretary Jeremy Miles was working \"urgently\" to ensure the same number of nurses could be trained.\nShe called for a review of higher education funding across the UK, including \"Treasury rules which govern the student finance system\", and said she had raised the matter with Labour UK government minister Jacqui Smith.\nHowells claimed that higher education funding in Wales compared \"favourably to other UK nations\" - being 18% higher than Scotland and was comparable to England now tuition fees were the same.\nEarlier, during Welsh Questions in the House of Commons, Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens called the proposed job losses at Cardiff University \"deeply concerning\" and a \"significant blow to university staff and their families\".\n\"I hope sufficient volunteers through a voluntary redundancy programme will come forward and be achieved in order to avoid any compulsory redundancies, and that support will be provided to those impacted,\" she said.\nBut she added that \"for the last 14 years the Conservative policies have seen our universities sector across the United Kingdom decimated\".\nStevens was replying to Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville-Roberts, who said an \"education disaster\" was \"playing out in real time\", and urged UK ministers to \"scrap national insurance hikes\" for employers to \"ease the strain on universities\".\nOn Tuesday Vice-Chancellor Professor Wendy Larner defended the decision to cut jobs, saying the university would have become \"untenable\" without drastic reforms.\nThe job role cuts are only a proposal, she said, but insisted the university needed to \"take difficult decisions\" due to the declining international student applications and increasing cost pressures.\nAsked, on Wednesday, what it message is to sixth form students considering applying to Cardiff University this September, particularly to endangered courses, a university spokesperson said: \"We'd reassure applicants and prospective students that programmes for 2025-2026 will continue; we are committed to an intake for the coming academic year.\"\nEx-minister says it shows policy was the most successful road safety initiative in modern times.\nThe project had been delayed after ministers called in the planning decision in October 2022.\nSome lecturers at Cardiff University have begun getting letters advising them their post is at risk.\nThere was strong opposition to Powys patients getting care in England waiting up to 11 weeks longer.\nRecent years have seen a significant increase in demand for puberty blockers.",

A 3-1 away defeat and 1-0 home loss knocked them out, with a first league reverse against Westerlo sandwiched in between.\nThough they recovered to beat Charleroi in their next league game, they would go on to win just one of their next 11 games, including a poor start to the Europa League, losing at Fenerbahce and Midtjylland along with a goalless home draw against Bodo/Glimt.\nSome clubs might have binned the rookie manager at that stage, but USG kept faith with Pocognoli and things began to improve from the end of October. Just one cup defeat in 18 games since then has them back in the top three and three wins on the bounce in the Europa League show they are in good fettle coming to Ibrox.\nRangers' injury problems are well documented, but the Belgians have major concerns of their own, compounded by the red cards shown by Nick Walsh (yes, that one) to defenders Koki Machida and Christian Burgess late in last week's 2-1 win over Braga.\nInjuries to regulars such as Alessio Castro-Montes and Sofiane Boufal as well as the non-inclusion of the likes of Promise David, who has 11 goals domestically, in the European squad echo the issues also facing Rangers' Belgian boss Philippe Clement.\nKevin Mac Allister, brother of Liverpool's Alexis, returns from suspension to help make up the back three while the main threat to Rangers' hopes of victory will likely be 21-year-old Croatian striker Franjo Ivanovic, who has 13 goals from 26 games, scoring two in each of the past two Europa League matches.\nBut Ivanovic and the ineligible David aside, this is not a team that scores a lot of goals – just seven in their seven Europa League games and the lowest league total of the Belgian top five.\nSo while not to be taken lightly, a repeat of the triumph of August 2022 should not be beyond Rangers.",

    "text": "We asked you to tell us one thing that no one is talking about regarding Fulham.\nHere are some of your comments:\nRobert:We have had a great season so far but I feel we are going to be stuck as a mid-table team as we were in our stint in the early 2000s. Unfortunately our midfield hasn't been as prolific as we would have thought, plus our strikers miss a lot of chances! If we want to get anywhere we need to start seeing chances go in! Smith Rowe and Andreas have not been as good as previous years, to which they need to step it up. We need a striker and a right winger to be competitive in my opinion.\nTerry:Lack of goals from midfield. Most teams in or around mid-table have a defensive midfielder who can score 3-4 screamers a season, we have no one. Sasa and Sander do sterling jobs but goals are a rarity.\nJeffrey:Fulham are one player short of being a half-decent side. There's a massive void upfront with no penetration. Sign a striker!\nRobbie:We need a striker that can create their own chances. There are lots of intricate passes but with no real end product in the form of goals. A striker that holds the ball up - like Zamora - and plays others in but who is also capable of creating his own chances is needed. Jimenez is not a creator or particularly clinical enough in my opinion and maybe if we can't find a Zamora then give Muniz more game time, and show him a few Zamora clips!! Maybe Muniz and Smith Rowe can link up and have an impact?\nSimon:Why is the atmosphere so bad at Craven Cottage? Is it that we've risen from crowds of 3,000-4,000 25 years ago to the Premier League and not developed a loud core group? Is it the ground? Is it too many posh fans? Or is it that, as many suspect, the club have alienated and priced out real fans in favour of tourists and corporates, chasing the merch money rather than hardcore loyal fans? The chickens will come home to roost; we didn't sell out against Man Utd so tickets went on general sale. Long-term fans are losing patience.\nJeff:Marco isn't the man to take us forward. Time after time we fall away in the second part of the season. There are poor performances against relegation threatened teams every season. I'd be happy with a change in the summer.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The funeral of John Prescott, former Labour deputy prime minister, has taken place at Hull Minster\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blairgave a eulogyto his \"personal friend\" and \"good man\" Prescott, praising his \"greatness of courage and character\"\nGordon Brown also spoke, while Sir Keir Starmergave a reading- other senior figures at the invitation-only service included Rachel Reeves and Angela Rayner, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan\nPrescottwas a major figure in Labour politics- a former trade union activist, he served in Blair's government for 10 years, and held his Kingston upon Hull East seat for almost 40 years\nHe died peacefully on 20 November, aged 86, at his care home where he had been living with Alzheimer's, his family said\nEdited by Jacqueline Howard and Rorey Bosotti, with Holly Phillips reporting from Hull Minster\nJacqueline HowardLive page editor\nWith the deep rumble of the engines of two Jags, a \"giant\" of the Labour Party has departed.\nThe applause of the crowd outside, and mix of sombre silence and small laughter as the guests departed Hull Minster summarise John Prescott's legacy well.\nWe heard him eulogised as a man of great personality, playfulness and ambition, plagued with self doubt, but who was determined to make his mark on the world.\nIf you'd like to read more on how John Prescott has been remembered,you can find further coverage in our main story.\nThank you for joining us.\nSpeaking to the BBC, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay\nHoyle, says of Prescott: \"He\nwas somebody I could be in awe of.\n\"He\nwas somebody who could bring the north together.\"\nJack\nStraw, a cabinet minister in the New Labour years, says: \"People\ntrusted him.\n\"People\nalways understood what John Prescott was talking about.\"\nLabour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has been speaking outside the service.\nHe says: \"My\nrecollection is that John was our voice in the Westminster system.\"\n\"He\nspoke in a way we could connect with,\" he says, adding: \"My\ngod, what a life he lived.\"\nLabour mayor of Liverpool City Region, Steve\nRotherham says: \"That\nis a role model for the soul.\n\"He\ndid eventually get one of the top jobs in the country, and didn't he do well\nwhen he was there.\"\nThe funeral service for John Prescott has just finished in Hull Minster. Here's a quick recap of the tributes we heard:\nHolly PhillipsReporting from Hull\nWe've just seen Prescott's coffin be loaded into the hearse and driven away.\nAs it happened, the crowd outside erupted into applause.\nIt is quiet again now as the guests leave - some look sombre while others are laughing.\nIn his closing remarks before the end of the service, the vicar of Hull talked of the creation of the NHS and new housing built following the \"hard-fought\" victory of the Attlee Labour government after World War Two, and the social changes that followed.\nDominic Black then turned to the New Labour anthem \"things can only get better\" - adding \"sadly not\". For many years \"we lived in promising times\", he says, describing increased social mobility, the fall of the Berlin Wall, peace in Northern Ireland and other changes.\nBut he says the rungs of the social mobility ladder are wobbling and broken, and \"troubling times are afoot in our world\".\nHistory does not repeat but maybe it riffs on itself, he says, adding: \"Today again we're seeing those who would offer simple, strongman solutions to the challenges of society, who would stir up again hatreds and divisions, those with furious thumbs, chattering keyboards, self-appointed judges.\"\nBut \"there is hope, things can better\", he says.\nCanon Dominic Black ends the service with a final reading from the bible and the congregation reciting of the Lord's Prayer.\nThe choir of Hull schoolchildren sing a final hymn.\nThe canon delivers the final blessing over the coffin and the service ends with the jazz classic Always by Irving Berlin as the coffin is carried from the church.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer is doing a reading from the Bible, Psalm 107.\nIt tells the story of merchants going out to sea, who faced with a storm lost their courage, but are then guided to safety after crying out to God for help.\nDeputy prime minister Angela Rayner takes over from Tony Blair to read the poem Here by Hull-based poet Philip Larkin.\nIt describes Hull and the surrounding area\nThe congregation is then asked to join to sing the hymn Amazing Grace.\nBlair reiterates that Prescott was a man who struggled with self-doubt, and goes on to pay tribute to his family.\n\"We will miss him,\" Blair says.\nAnd concluding his remarks, he says \"I hope if John's looking down on us, and not already in negotiation with St Peter over the accommodation, I hope he will see in this vast gathering today, a recognition of that working-class boy from a small Welsh town, who rose to the highest ranks of the land by merit, by graft, by greatness of courage and character, and he will feel deservedly at peace.\"\nBlair continues his tribute, saying that Prescott had the brain to make an argument and personality to make it appealing.\n\"That personality,\" he says wistfully,\" will be forever memorialised by the punch.\"\nHe recalls the tale of Prescott punching a man who threw an egg on him in 2001.\n\"I'm not bloody well apologising and that's the end of it,\" Blair recounts Prescott telling him.\n\"Classic,\" Blair laughs.\nBlair says he watched the video again, trying to feel outrage, but found himself cheering Prescott on.\nWe're now hearing from former PM Tony Blair.\nHe opens by saying: \"Some lights exude a dull grey, and the challenge is to fill the canvas, and some are so bursting in colour that the challenge is to contain them in a single portrait.\n\"No one ever described John as dull or grey. John was a complicated man, wrestling frequently with the tangle of altruism and ambition that motivates political animals\"\nPrescott possessed \"deep principles\" but was also determined to \"make his mark\", Blair says. Self-doubt regularly overflowed in him, he says, but that was a spur that drove him to seek struggle and pull himself up\nHis achievements were extraordinary, Blair says, listing reforms he helped achieve in government.\nHe pioneered the idea of an integrated transport system, he championed inner city generation, Blair says, adding: \"Throw him a problem and he would provide a solution.\"\n\"What places the affection alongside the admiration is John the character. There is not one of us who thinks of John without a smile,\" Blair says, before going on to describe him as \"guardian\" party's conscience and its educator.\nDavid continues his eulogy discussing his father's health struggles - and his continued commitment to continue working.\nHe notes that after suffering a stroke in 2019, Prescott \"set himself the task of learning to read again using his grandchildren's school books\".\n\"Within a couple of months he amazed his doctors and terrified his family by going to back to  Westminster on Hull Trains three times a week,\" David says.\nHe then pulls up a copy of his father's 1968 speech to the East Hull Labour Party when he ran to be selected as a candidate.\nDavid Prescott concludes his eulogy reading a part of the speech, joking: \"I'd like to finish this family eulogy by reading part of it so John can have the last word.\n\"Because, as you know, John always had the last word.\"\nThe speech ends \"'Comrades I hope I can help'. You did dad, you did\" his son says.\nWe're now hearing from David Prescott who is paying tribute to his late father on behalf of the family.\n\"The memories of Dad you have all shared with us have been a great source of comfort as we've sought to process our grief - so thank you,\" he says.\n\"He was a man who spent his life overcoming challenges and serving others,\" he says, but adds he would like to share the John Prescott that the family knew, the husband, the father and the grandfather.\nHe goes on to talk about his father's life and describes how John met his mother Pauline in 1957 at a bus stop.\nWhat many people may not know is that his father was \"full of self-about and incredibly shy\", David says, describing how he could give a speech to a large crowd but was \"very embarrassed in social situations\".\nWe grew up in a house full of jazz, David says, describing how his brother Jonathan shares that love of music.\n\"For me,\" David says, \"he taught me the importance of lifting people up and not putting people down.\"\nTwo Jaguars formed part of the funeral cortege for John Prescott\nIn a surely deliberate nod to the nickname “two Jags”  the funeral cortege included a Jaguar hearse and limousine.\nLord Prescott was dubbed \"two Jags\" by the press after it was revealed he used two Jaguar cars – one of them his own and the second a ministerial car.\nDuring the Labour conference in Bournemouth in 1999, his government car took him 250 yards from his hotel to the conference centre.\nOn stage, as environment and transport secretary, he then urged motorists to cut their carbon emissions by using public transport.\nHe later claimed he had taken the short journey by car because his wife, Pauline, did not like to have her hair blown about on the seafront.\nThe funeral congregation has been shown a short video of key moments from Prescott's political life.\nThe children's choir sings again before Prescott's son, David, starts his own tribute to his father.\nApplause breaks out in the Minister as Gordon Brown pays tribute to John Prescott's wife Pauline.\n\"Remember especially today both John and Pauline together,\nthat most glamorous couple,\" he says.\n\"I want us to thank Pauline today for her charm, for her\nelegance, for her dignity for her wisdom, for her partnership with and in\nsupport of John right from his seafaring and student days and across 63 years\nof marriage.\"\n\"Pauline we thank you for everything you have done\".\n\"John, we remember the advice you gave in one of your final interviews,\" Brown concludes. \"You said: be true to yourself, do what you can do for the best and especially think of others.\"\nContinuing his tribute, Brown tells the service of Prescott's sense of humour.\nHe describes a time when Prescott was due to give a speech and was to be followed by Peter Mandelson. Brown recalls Prescott saying: \"It's a sort of charm offensive. I'll leave you to work out who is charming and who is offensive.\"\nBrown goes on: \"We will never see his like again. A man of the people he certainly was. In a class by himself, a one-off, one of a kind but one of us in the best sense of the word.\"\n\"The John you saw in Hull and the John you saw at home was the John you saw in Downing Street,\" he says.\nFormer PM Gordon Brown delivers the opening eulogy, paying tribute to Prescott's parliamentary career.\n“For sixty years this great city of Hull was John’s home,\" Brown says. “The home he loved, the home he served with pride, passion and principle.”\n\"So it’s right we meet here today in this famous 600 year-old cathedral,\" he adds. \"Immortalised in statues and plaques all around us Hull’s members of parliament from William Wilberforce to John.”\nThe service has begun - Vicar of Hull Minster Dominic Black begins with a prayer.\nThe choir is performing Eternal Father, Strong to Save - a traditional hymn associated with seafarers.\nThis is an apparent nod to John Prescott'scareer in the Merchant Navybefore he turned to politics.",

You can't build a runway, particularly overCommonwealth War graves.\n\"These are people who fought for our country and yet this is how they're being treated, just tarmacked over their graves.\n\"How can you do that morally? It's just very, very saddening to see.\"\nEmily has also lived in the village for all of her life.\nShe described the announcement as \"really, really sad\" and lamented that she would not be able to regale her children with tales of her own childhood in the area.\nShe said: \"I'll never get to say 'this is where I went to school, this is my local park, this is where I liked to kick a football'.\n\"This is where I used to come and get penny sweets when sweets were a penny.\n\"This is where I used to take a walk with my family through the local park. I'll never get to do that with my kids.\"\nRob Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said the expansion would put the village even closer to thePublic Safety Zone, sited at the end of runways and which aim to reduce the number of people living, working and congregating in an area.\nHe said: \"Life would be very, very difficult living like that.\n\"It wouldn't surprise me if some of these listed buildings would shake and fall down so it would be very difficult to build any sort of community which has existed in this area for a long, long time.\n\"It's very difficult at the moment and you know the prospect of this hanging over a lot of people is creating a lot of distress.\"\nAdditional reporting by Gem O'Reilly\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "text": "Damaged hearts could be mended using small \"patches\" of heart muscle grown in the lab, say scientists writing in Nature.\nThe technology could give new hope to millions of people with advanced heart failure whose treatment options are currently limited,the German researchers say.\nBased on early results of a small trial in humans and promising tests in monkeys, the patches appear to support the pumping of the heart safely.\nHowever, the long-term potential of the treatment is as yet unknown, with a clinical trial in 15 patients still ongoing.\nThe patches are grown from another person's stem cells - special cells which can be turned into any number of different cell types - and made into heart muscle cells.\nThe lab-grown cardiac tissue can then be grafted on to beating hearts to help them repair.\nIt is like \"implanting young muscle\", says study author Ingo Kutschka, from University Medical Center Goettingen.\nA small incision is made in the chest and the 3.5in (9cm) by 1.5in patch is stitched on to the surface of the heart.\n\"It's tricky because the tissues are floppy, and you have to take care to make it stay in shape,\" he says.\nThere have been encouraging results in trials of the patches on primates and on one human patient.\nThe 46-year-old woman had a heart attack in 2016, then developed heart failure which got steadily worse. In 2021, after all possible treatments had been tried, she chose to have a heart patch.\nThe researchers say her condition was stable and she experienced no side effects from the implant, before having a heart transplant three months later.\nThe patch was able to \"adapt, grow, mature and start to support the failing heart,\" says lead author Prof Wolfram-Hubertus Zimmermann.\nHer case shows that new muscle can be added to failing hearts \"without safety concerns, such as tumours and arrhythmia [irregular heart rhythms]\", he added.\nThe patches of engineered heart muscle have to survive in the patient and be nurtured over several months, so are not useful for people who need emergency care, the researchers say.\nIn trials on monkeys, the research team found the patches were good at contracting, enhancing and thickening the heart wall, which improved the pumping of the whole heart.\nHeart failure is the leading cause of death worldwide, but there are few effective ways of fixing the organ once it is broken.\nIt is a condition that makes even simple daily tasks, like climbing the stairs or getting dressed, exhausting.\nHeart devices can be costly and come with complications, and a heart transplant - although the best solution - is rarely an option.\nProf Zimmermann says: \"99% of patients with heart failure won't receive a new heart.\"\nThe researchers have more to learn from the current human trial and plan a long-term follow-up of 15 patients to find out more about the health of those living with the patches for years.\nProf James Leiper, director of research at the British Heart Foundation charity, said the early results were \"promising\", but trials in a larger number of patients were needed \"to determine the effectiveness of the heart patch in humans\".\n\"If these are positive, it could help to usher in a new era of heart failure treatment,\" he said.\nPrevious attempts to inject heart muscle cells into people's failing hearts have had mixed results.\n\"Off the shelf\" heart patches like the ones used in this study - made from millions of human stem cells and grown into working heart muscle - are seen to be a less dangerous option, although patients would need to take strong drugs to prevent their bodies rejecting them.\nUsing the patient's own stem cells to develop heart tissue has been attempted, but this process takes a very long time and previous trials using these grafts were not encouraging.\nThe charity Race Against Blood Cancer is looking for a match for 21-year-old Marshall Davies.\nAbbie has had rare blood disorder since university and transplant is her only chance of a future.\nResearchers hope science used in Covid vaccines can limit the impact of the winter vomiting bug.\nOne of the UK's first coronavirus evacuees says people still joke that he brought the virus to Britain.\nMany frequent A&E visitors are lonely or experiencing poor mental health, says a new support service.",

    "text": "The first year of a controversial Welsh speed limit saw around 100 fewer people killed or seriously injured on 20 and 30mph roads, ministers have said.\nNew casualty data for the first year of the 20mph limit was welcomed by the Welsh government, while the Labour politician who spearheaded the policy said it showed it was \"the most successful road safety intervention in modern times\".\nThe figures showed the number of people hurt fell by 28% compared with the same period the year before, with ten fewer dead.\nThe number of casualties on 20 to 30mph roads between July and September 2024 was also the lowest for the three month-period since records began in 1979.\nAmid longstanding rows over the speed limit within his own party, former transport minister Lee Waters urged others not to undermine the scheme.\nThe Conservatives said the policy remained confusing and frustrating for drivers.\nThe Welsh government switched the default speed limit on mostly urban roads on 17 September 2023, and with some exemptions most 30mph roads became 20.\nIntroduced while Mark Drakeford was first minister, the scheme proved to be one of the Welsh government's most controversial initiatives since devolution began, and almost half a million peoplesigned a petition calling for it to be scrapped.\nThe public backlash prompted areviewof the policy, and councils are currently considering whether more roads can be switched back to 30mph.\nOn Wednesday new road casualty figures were published for July to September 2024 - meaning statistics are now available for the first year of the 20mph scheme.\nIn the third quarter of 2024 - July to September - there were 410 road casualties from road collisions on 20 and 30mph roads - three were fatalities, 90 were serious and 317 were slight casualties.\nThis was 35% lower than in the same quarter in 2023, the Welsh government said, and the lowest since records began.\nDuring the 12 month period from October 2023 to September 2024, when the 20mph limit was in place, the number of collisions was 26% lower than the same period the year before.\nGovernment officials have urged caution in attributing the fall in casualties to the 20mph limit.\nThe Welsh government's chief statistician said in a blog last year that at least three year's worth of collision data would be required for a meaningful comparison to be made.\nCasualty figures have also been on a downward trend for sometime - the Welsh government said they have \"declined steadily over the last decade\".\nThe Welsh government has commissioned a five year review of the policy, which will report back in 2029.\nIt will include a cost and benefit assessment of the impact of the speed limit on the Welsh economy.\nFirst Minister Eluned Morgan said: \"These stats show how 20mph is saving lives - leading to fewer collisions, deaths and serious injuries.\n\"We must get the right speeds on the right roads, but to see these figures falling is positive.\"\nHer Transport Secretary Ken Skates said: \"We know there is a way to go and we've always said it will take a number of years to see the full impact of the policy but to see the figures for this quarter at their lowest level is positive.\"\nLee Waters, now a backbench Labour MS who was transport minister under former First Minister Mark Drakeford, said: \"We can now say with confidence that in its first year the speed limit reduction represents the most successful road safety intervention in modern times.\n\"As we said in advance, a little bit slower but a whole lot better.\"\nThe policy had proved divisive within the Labour Party as well as the wider public - the current First Minister Eluned Morganhas admitted problems in the way the policy was implemented.\nIn his statement Waters added: \"We need to make sure we now don't undermine this excellent progress.\"\nConservative shadow transport secretary Peter Fox added:  \"While we welcome any decrease in road casualties, these figures don't tell the whole story. Our concern remains the way the 20mph speed limit has been implemented.\n\"The Welsh Labour government's default approach has created confusion and frustration for drivers and their current review must address these implementation issues and ensure a more sensible and effective approach.\"\nBy Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor\nThe contrast in language between the man now in charge of transport and the man who drove the 20mph law through might well cause you to slam the brakes on and take a closer look.\nEven allowing for the caveat of more time needed for a full evaluation, Ken Skates' cautious welcome highlights how toxic an issue 20mph has become for Welsh Labour.\nIt came up time and time again out on the road during the general election campaign – even though it's a Welsh government and not Westminster issue – and a Senedd election is looming.\nIf the evidence does eventually show that the drop in casualties is definitively linked to 20mph then it could cause an issue for the law's political opponents - especially the Conservatives and Reform – should public support for 20mph start to grow.\nSome people are unhappy about the new speed limits in Hayle and St Ives.\nThe project had been delayed after ministers called in the planning decision in October 2022.\nOne local councillor says pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders are \"at the mercy\" of fast drivers.\nA force sees a 7% increase in the number of younger people arrested for driving under the influence.\nThe road is closed overnight until work is completed in the summer.",

It is due to reopen by 05:30 GMT on Saturday.\nEngineers \"will use technology similar to the surface of a non-stick frying pan to slide the viaduct into position\" over the road and railway line, HS2 said.\nRail passengers will be affected on Saturday and Sunday, when the Chiltern Railways line between Great Missenden and Aylesbury will be closed.\nThe A413 closure includes the Wendover bypass southbound, the Missenden bypass, Dunsmore Lane and London Road going into Wendover.\nDiversions will be put in place, the company said.\nIt hopes to open the road sooner than scheduled, depending on how the installation goes.\nThe 6m (19ft)-high Small Dean viaduct is one of two places in the Chilterns where the railway route will be above ground.\nHS2 said the installation of the viaduct is a \"delicate operation\" and \"will be the heaviest and longest single-stage viaduct deck slide on the HS2 project so far\".\nIt is one of five on the project to be built with a \"double composite\" structure.\nThis uses two steel beams sandwiched between layers of reinforced concrete to create a lightweight and super strong hollow span, said the company.\nUnlike other viaducts on the project, Small Dean viaduct was assembled in one piece and will be pushed out across the road and railway line \"in the heaviest and longest single-stage deck slide on the project so far\", it added.\nThe £71bn HS2 project is designed to improve links between London and the West Midlands.\nIt was originally meant to connect London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds; but the link between Birmingham and Manchester was scrapped by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in October 2023.\nIt has faced criticism about the impact of the proposed route on swathes of countryside and woodland, amid setbacks and soaring costs.\nOnce trains have crossed the viaduct, northbound trains will pass Wendover in a tunnel, the company said.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.\nPyford Brook Quarry near Alrewas will operate beyond its permitted hours until the end of March.\nThe A46 Kenilworth Bypass will shut in the spring for a key structure to be moved into place.\nPyford Brook Quarry says it needs to operate outside its permitted hours to support HS2 work.\nResidents living on the original HS2 route say they remain unable to get on with their lives.\nMark Wild said the high-speed project needed a \"fundamental reset\" as HS2 issued an update.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "An expert has been accused of signing off fire safety certificates for flats in high-rise blocks using the credentials and signature of another engineer without permission, the BBC has been told.\nAdam Kiziak has been under investigation for potential malpractice by the Institution of Fire Engineers (IFE) - which suspended him in August 2024.\nHowever, Mr Kiziak's company is understood to have continued to sign off safety certificates since then.\nLenders, including NatWest and Nationwide, are now withdrawing mortgage offers to people hoping to buy flats with fire safety certificates issued by Mr Kiziak's company, Tri Fire.\nMr Kiziak's lawyer told the BBC: \"Any allegation of fraudulent activity is strenuously denied.\"\nTri Fire carries out safety surveys and issues fire safety certificates for flats in high-rise blocks across the UK. These certificates, known as EWS1s, were introduced in 2019 after the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people.\nThe form rates the fire risk of a building based on its overall construction and an assessment of any cladding. The majority of banks and building societies require EWS1 certificates when deciding whether to lend money on flats in apartment blocks.\nThere is no official register of EWS1 certificates, but analysis by the Building Safety Register has found 410 of the 1,139 EWS1s signed off between March 2020 and the end of 2021 were issued by Tri Fire.\nMr Kiziak, who is still allowed to work, can't sign off safety certificates while he is suspended by the IFE.\nAwwal Salisu, a qualified fire engineer based in Saudi Arabia, told the BBC he entered into an agreement with Tri Fire via a recruitment agency to assess up to 100 buildings.\nHe believes Mr Kiziak used his signature without his knowledge to allow him to continue issuing safety certificates.\nIn the majority of cases, Mr Salisu alleges there was insufficient information to be able to issue safety certificates and returned the forms to Mr Kiziak's company for further work.\nBut the BBC has seen a number of EWS1 forms carrying Mr Salisu's signature and using his IFE membership number, which Mr Salisu says were not among the 100 he was asked to review and which he knew nothing about.\n\"I am very angry about it,\" says Mr Salisu. \"I've had sleepless nights - my reputation is at stake.\"\nMr Salisu says he uses a unique electronic signature on documents that can be traced back to him using the IP address on his laptop\nHe added: \"The one good thing about all of this is every report that is submitted with my initials, none of them will actually have my electronic signature.\"\nHe has written to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the IFE and UK Finance - which oversees the mortgage lending market - to alert them to what he believes has happened.\nSome major lenders say that they have now stopped offering mortgages on homes signed off as safe by Mr Kiziak, leaving buyers in limbo.\nFirst-time buyer Sam Ireland told the BBC his mortgage offer was retracted when his lender discovered the fire safety assessment of the property he hoped to buy had been issued by Tri Fire.\n\"You feel completely powerless,\" says Sam, who now has to start looking for another flat to buy and arrange another mortgage. \"It's just scuppered the whole thing.\"\nThe BBC has also learned of other people whose applications have been rejected by other lenders where Mr Kiziak's firm was involved.\nMr Kiziak's lawyer told the BBC they were unable to offer any further detail as there is a pending investigation, but added their client was \"very sorry for any distress and the difficulties that the current situation may have caused\".\nThe IFE declined to comment further while its investigation is ongoing.\nThe government recently announced plans to speed up the process of getting the thousands of tower blocks with flammable cladding and fire safety defects fixed.\nA Freedom of Information request by Construction News found more than 60 blocks accepted into the government's taxpayer-funded Cladding Safety Scheme had been carried out by Tri Fire, throwing into doubt if they have been correctly assessed.",

    "text": "We asked for your views on whether Robert Sanchez is still the best option for Chelsea, or if the club should look at bringing Kepa Arrizabalaga back.\nHere are some of your comments:\nNick:While Kepa would be a (slight) upgrade on Sanchez, rather than bring him back from his loan, Chelsea should make more use of Filip Jorgensen. Why spend £20m on a goalkeeper who made the most saves in La Liga last season and not play him? Jorgensen can't be judged on just the odd cup or Conference League game and deserves a run of 10 or more Premier League games to show he can cut the mustard.\nTom:Why is the conversation Kepa or Sanchez when we have a great keeper in Djordje Petrovic and as he's at Strasbourg he'd probably be easier to recall?\nScott:I would take Arrizabalaga over Sanchez any day of the week. There is a good keeper in Arrizabalaga - he just needs honing.  Sanchez however gives away three opportunities for the opposition to score almost every match and this cannot continue if Chelsea are to have any chance at success.\nRebecca:I don't think Sanchez is good enough to be part of a title-winning team. When I think back to other world-class keepers we've had in the past - Petr Cech, Thibaut Courtois, and Edouard Mendy - a top goalie wins you games, and Sanchez isn't capable of performing at that high level on a consistent basis.\nJohn:Petrovic was our best keeper last season. Madness he didn't start this season. We need him back quickly.",

Every waking moment - and most of the sleeping ones I think - is absolutely consumed with Swansea City Football Club.\n\"I am certainly not going to run for cover. I cannot wait for good times again and I look forward to deserving [to hear] the fans singing my name. I love that - there's nothing better - but you need to earn it.\"\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\nSwans 'move on' as Cabango replaces Grimes as captain\nSwansea moved to within four points of the Championship play-off places courtesy of back-to-back home wins at the end of December.\nBut their form since has collapsed, scoring just three goals and conceding 18 during January.\nThe Swans were though unfortunate to lose their most recent home game, when Harry Darling was sent off against Sheffield United, and Williams has \"full confidence\" that their form will turn around.\nWilliams pointed to the struggles this season of Manchester City and Manchester United as evidence that \"all clubs suffer\".\nBut he added: \"Certainly we have to be able to withstand the pressure. We have to come out fighting and be able to give everybody that loves this club a boost.\nJay Fulton is a contender to come into Swansea's midfield on Saturday as a replacement for Matt Grimes\n\"It's extremely challenging, we are in a very competitive division with some very capable teams and some tough environments for players to deal with.\n\"But we have to overcome all of those things to give everybody a boost and make them feel excited again about their team.\"\nGrimes' imminent move to Coventry means Williams will be forced to reshuffle in midfield, while Hannes Delcroix is set for his home Swansea debut with Darling again absent through suspension having sat out last weekend's 5-1 defeat at Norwich City.\nCoventry are four points better off than Swansea in 12th having won three successive league games – their best run of the season.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Several of President Donald Trump's cabinet nominees faced tough questioning from Republicans and Democrats alike during hours-long confirmation hearings on Thursday.\nFormer Democrat and military veteran Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, was grilled about her past remarks supporting government whistleblower Edward Snowden as well as her relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syria's former dictator Bashar al-Assad.\nNominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, a former federal prosecutor and Trump administration aide, was pressed on his prior comments praising those involved in the 6 January Capitol riots as well as his ties to the QAnon movement.\nHere are some of the most memorable moments of the heated hearings.\nGabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who ran for her party's presidential nomination in 2020 before ditching the party and endorsing Trump in 2024, faced sharp questions about her past remarks about Russia's war in Ukraine. She has been accused of repeating Russian propaganda to justify Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\nAt one point during the hearing, Democratic Senator Michael Bennet read several of Gabbard's previous comments out loud, including when she said Putin had \"legitimate security concerns\" over Nato expansion in Eastern Europe.\nThe Colorado lawmaker accused Gabbard of agreeing that a \"totalitarian state\" was \"justified in rolling over the peaceful border of Ukraine\".\nHe noted that Russian state TV aired her comments and called her \"our friend Tulsi\".\nGabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who was twice deployed to the Middle East, has no formal intelligence experience.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats quizzed Gabbard about her support for Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower who leaked millions of classified documents that he alleged showed the US was conducting illegal surveillance of its citizens.\nCritics said the leaks threatened American national security.\nLawmakers asked Gabbard multiple times whether she considered Snowden - someone whom she has previously called \"brave\" and argued should be pardoned for his crimes - a traitor to the US.\nGabbard dug in her heels on the matter, refusing to give a yes or no answer and making the moment uneasy for several Republicans.\n\"Snowden broke the law,\" she told lawmakers. \"He released information about the United States … I have more immediate steps that I would take to prevent another Snowden.\"\nGabbard also faced scrutiny for a 2017 visit to Syria to meet then-President Bashar al-Assad.\nThe trip came after the US government demanded Assad step down because of his government's attacks against its civilians, including with chemical weapons. Her trip drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle at the time.\nAt the hearing on Thursday, Gabbard told lawmakers that she asked Assad \"tough questions about his own regime's actions\".\nShe also attempted to pre-emptively address incoming attacks over the visit, saying in her opening remarks: \"I have no love for Assad or Gaddafi or any dictator.\"\nGabbard added that she \"shed no tears for the fall of the Assad regime\" in December, when armed rebels took over the Syrian city of Damascus.\n\"But today we have an Islamist extremist who is now in charge of Syria,\" she said.\nDuring Patel's  five-hour hearing following Gabbard's on Thursday, the former prosecutor came under fire for his previous support for Capitol rioters.\nHe once helped promote sales of a charity song recorded by the 6 January rioters in prison, including some who had been convicted of violence against police officers.\nSeveral Democratic senators tried to push Patel about his ties to the rioters.\n\"Was President Donald Trump wrong to give blanket clemency to the January 6 defendants?\" Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois asked.\n\"I have always rejected any violence against law enforcement, including in that group, any violence against law enforcement on January 6,\" Patel responded.\nStill at several points, Patel declined to criticise Trump's pardon of rioters who assaulted officers.\nPatel, a outspoken critic of the agency he's been tapped to lead and a Trump loyalist, struck a more moderate tone on Thursday compared to some of his previous comments.\nExplaining his criticisms of the FBI, Patel pointed to public opinion surveys that show declining confidence in the agency and highlighted two priorities, including tackling violent crime, which he said was \"exploding in this country\".\nIf confirmed, he said, \"I will remain focused on the FBI's core mission, that is to investigate fully wherever there is a constitutional factual basis to do so\".\nBut Democrats continued to press him on his previous statements and activities.\nPatel wrote a book called Government Gangsters, laying out his theories about a so-called \"deep state\" targeting Trump.\nHe has also expressed sympathy with the QAnon movement – a conspiracy theory which broadly speaking claims that a ring of satanic paedophiles operates inside the highest levels of government, media and business.\nWith reporting from Phil McCAusland\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe concert, which also featured Dr Dre and Pink, took place to help raise funds to rebuild the LA area.\nThe collision between a passenger plane and a military helicopter is suspected to have killed all 67 onboard.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Former workers at a four-star hotel which closed suddenly claim they are owed thousands of pounds in unpaid wages.\nWroxall Abbey Hotel in Warwickshire was operated by JGBM Hotel Limited until 21 January, when the building's owners terminated its lease and repossessed the estate.\nWorkers contacted the BBC before the closure and said they have had to \"battle\" to try to get their pay from a director of JGBM Hotel Limited, Paresh Thakkar.\nMr Thakkar denied not paying staff but admitted there were cash flow issues which had caused delayed payments.\nIn a statement, Mr Thakkar said: \"Severe historical financial constraints that I inherited as owner of the hotel have continued to pose serious challenges to the business.\"\nOn its website before it was taken offline, Wroxall Abbey Hotel was portrayed as a \"luxurious\" hotel with 72 bedrooms and \"the perfect location for any wedding\".\nSet in 27 acres (11 hectares) of land, \"extensive conference facilities\" were offered along with dining experiences including afternoon tea from £35 per person.\nBut former staff criticised what they described as the chaotic management of the hotel over the last year, with more than a dozen claiming they were still owed wages. For some employees, this was thousands of pounds.\nOther allegations included inaccurate payslips not reflecting what hours the employees say they worked. Mr Thakkar denied that this was the case.\nDale Povey worked there for a month as a receptionist from September and said she was owed about £250.\n\"I realised he wasn't going to pay any of us. It was a pattern,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It's not a lot, but it is for me,\" she said, adding she was only paid when a receptionist walked out and Mr Thakkar was \"desperate\".\n\"I need Paresh to pay people what they're owed and to stop taking advantage,\" she said.\nObafemi Olusanya, who said he was owed about £900-£1,000, told the BBC: \"I feel it's not normal for somebody to use people like that, it doesn't make any sense to me.\"\nAlan Collins worked at the hotel from July to November as a gardener and maintenance worker and claimed he was owed £2,800 in wages.\nHe said employee turnover was high: \"People [were] coming and going. Every day there were different people coming.\n\"You notice over a week they'd be disappearing.\"\nAs a result of the payment delays, the father-of-three said he had no money at Christmas.\nThe former employees also made an array of allegations about how the site was run, including concerns there were no records or procedures for food allergens, fire evacuations, or legionella water supply testing.\nMr Thakkar denied this and said he could not produce documents for fire evacuation procedures, legionella testing and allergens as they were in the hotel and he no longer had access, after the termination of JGBM Hotel Limited's lease.\nHe said fire alarm tests were carried out on a monthly basis, but several members of staff the BBC spoke to said they had never heard a fire alarm test while working at the hotel.\nOn one occasion, employees say a flood caused there to be no hot water in the hotel, at a time when food was being served to customers at an event.\nMr Thakkar said this was not the case, as the dishwasher had its own hot water system, before saying that people were \"just trying to make things up\".\nWhen asked by the BBC if allegations were true that bailiffs and contractors had been known to turn up at the hotel asking for money, Mr Thakkar said: \"It's part of business.\"\nA member of kitchen staff also filmed Tesco own-brand food, including scones, being prepared for the hotel's afternoon tea which were then served to guests, when the website claimed all pastries were freshly made on a daily basis by the chef.\nMr Thakkar admitted that supermarket food was bought in cases where allergens were concerned, such as gluten-free scones, as it was not cost-effective to make them in-house - but the footage obtained by the BBC showed scones that were not gluten-free.\nWhen asked about the Tesco food being bought for the afternoon teas, Mr Thakkar said: \"That's not illegal, is it?\"\nAddressing the allegations overall, Mr Thakkar said he completely refuted them and that they had been made up by people he described as \"disgruntled ex-employees\" of the hotel. He denied any unfair or unethical treatment.\nThe hotel remains closed since the termination of JGBM Hotel Limited's lease, with the Wroxall Abbey Hotel website currently down \"for maintenance\".\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.\nWarwickshire's Wroxall Abbey shuts after the estate's owners terminated the leaseholder's tenancy.\nThe incident in Wroxall was between a blue Ford Focus and a double-decker bus, police say.",

He's fired prosecutors who investigated him. He's investigating other prosecutors, or his department of justice is. He's fired inspectors general who might hold him accountable,\" Schiff says. \"And this is just the start.\"\n\"As FBI director nominee, [Trump] has chosen someone whose primary qualification, in my view, is his willingness to say 'yes' when everyone else would say 'no'.\"\nSchiff didn't ask Patel any questions during his final three minutes.\nPatel is again asked about the now-dropped classified documents case, where Donald Trump was accused of illegally taking documents from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago home after his first term.\nPatel has been accused by Democratic senators in this hearing of not answering their questions on this matter, earlier appearing to upset Adam Schiff, and then frustrating Cory Booker.\n\"Did you or did you not see the president of the United States declassify the documents he was holding?\" Booker asks twice.\n\"I don't know the answer to that question, because I don't know what was fully found,\" Patel replies, shortly after saying he witnessed Trump \"issue a declassification order\".\n\"So this is the issue - the question is, will you lie for the president of the United States? Would you lie for Donald Trump?\" Booker asks.\n\"No,\" Patel says.\nBooker - like Schiff - then calls on Patel to agree to allow the courts to release Patel's testimony about the classified files case before a grand jury. Patel disputes that he is legally allowed to do so.\nCory Booker\nKash Patel\nRepublican Senator Marsha Blackburn asks Patel about DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion), raising concerns about the \"emphasis\" she says the FBI has put on DEI.\nShe argues the agency needs \"qualified individuals\" who stick to the \"core mission\", asking Patel about his first actions to \"build back\" recruiting and training.\nPatel, who would be the first Indian-American to lead the FBI, says people who sign up have to meet \"rigorous high standards\", including physical standards, and he adds that those requirements will not change.\nPatel predicts an \"exponential\" increase in enrolment. He is asked by Blackburn whether this will be a \"day one item\". \"Yes ma'am,\" he responds.\nWhat is DEI?\nDEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) programmes aim to promote participation in workplaces by people from a range of backgrounds.\nBackers of DEI say it addresses historical or ongoing discrimination and underrepresentation of certain groups, including racial minorities, but critics argue such programmes can themselves be discriminatory.\nRepublican Senator Eric Schmitt turns the hearing back to the FBI's \"core mission\" and asks what Patel's priorities would be in the role.\nPatel, 44, responds that there is an \"underlying underbelly\" for most organised crime and that is narco-trafficking.\nHe says the FBI has not prioritised the \"collective power\" that can be brought upon criminal narco-trafficking networks.\nPatel further speaks of wanting to set up regional drug interdiction taskforces - ensuring local law enforcement are \"folded in\" with the FBI to share information and authority. He adds that he would want to work with Pam Bondi, if she is confirmed as attorney general, on these issues.\nSenator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, questions Patel about the White House's recent and abrupt firing of over a dozen inspectors general, who act as watchdogs of various federal agencies. Critics say the firings were illegal.\n\"We passed a law in 2022 requiring the president to provide Congress with a 'substantive rationale', including detailed and case-specific reasons, 30 days before the removal of any inspectors general,\" Coons says.\nPatel says Trump has been in office \"approximately 10 days\", seeming to indirectly acknowledge that Trump's time in office would not meet the 30-day requirement cited by Coons.\n\"Did Trump violate facially, violate this law in terms of the timing of the firing of the inspectors general?\" Coons asks.\nPatel says he's not going to \"entertain a hypothetical legal violation\", adding: \"I will look into all possible legal violations referred.\"\nMike WendlingUS digital reporter\nDemocrats have been making it pretty clear that out of all of Donald Trump’s nominees, Kash Patel is one that they intend to push\nhard against.\nQuestions about the proposed FBI director even came up during\nother nomination hearings, for Trump’s attorney general pick Pam Bondi.\nBut Republicans on the committee today have steadfastly defended\nPatel in the face of questioning about his support for the Capitol rioters, his\ntheories about political bias in law enforcement and his allegations that a “deep\nstate” has unfairly targeted Donald Trump.\nPatel himself has toned down his message, talking about\ntransparency and standards rather than, for instance, his book Government\nGangsters, which includes a list of 60 Trump opponents identified as “Members\nof the Executive Branch deep state”.\nToday, Patel has sidestepped questions about violent rioters\nand has generally appeared less feisty than he can be. But while he may count on\nRepublican support – he’ll need the votes of nearly all the party's senators to get confirmed\n– he doesn’t appear to have allayed any concerns among Democrats.\nWhile Kash Patel is a former federal prosecutor who has held high-profile and short-term roles in national security and defence, he does not fit the mould of most FBI directors.\nWhen Trump sought in his first term to put Patel in a senior FBI position, then-Attorney General Bill Barr objected.\n\"Someone with no background as an agent would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day operations of the bureau,\" Barr wrote in his 2022 book.\nPatel today cited polling suggesting that Americans of all political stripes have lost faith in the FBI and he argued a new approach is needed to restore faith in the agency.\nFor more on Patel's background, see our storyhere.\nFormer US Attorney General Bill Barr\nSenator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Justice Committee, asks Patel if he will \"commit\" to releasing records that he's been asking for from the FBI related to an investigation of Joe Biden and his family.\n\"FBI has yet to provide us the underlying intelligence that they said formed the basis for the [Biden investigation] briefing,\" Grassley says.\n\"So, if confirmed, I want you to work with me to finally get to the bottom of what happened here.\"\nPatel replies: \"You have my commitment.\"\nAlthough Patel won’t criticise Donald Trump’s pardoning of\nthe Capitol rioters, not everyone on the Republican side is so reluctant.\n“Every one of those people in the Capitol, I’ve said, were\nthugs, and I don’t apologise for it,” says Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\nBut Tillis, going on something of a monologue, argues for\nconsistency. He brings up violent riots by racial justice protesters in 2020 and\ndemands that his Democratic colleagues show “balance”.\nThe senator then holds up a bingo card that he first waved at the start of the hearing,\nwhich had a list of possible Democratic lines of attack against Patel that could come up during the\nhearing.\n“I’ve hit bingo several times,” he says to laughter in the\nroom.\nCalifornia Senator Adam Schiff appears to grow frustrated as he questions Kash Patel about a since-dropped prosecution of Donald Trump for keeping sensitive files at his Florida home.\n\"Did you claim that Donald Trump declassified all the documents at Mar-a-Lago?\" Schiff asks repeatedly.\nPatel makes the distinction that he said Trump had declassified \"a large number of documents\".\nFor background, Patel was subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury about the classified documents case. The justice department gave up the prosecution after Trump won the last election.\nSenator Adam Schiff\nMike WendlingUS digital reporter\nKash Patel is questioned by Democrats about his\npromotion of a song from the so-called “J6 prison choir”.\nThis is a recording made by rioters who were arrested after storming the Capitol on 6 January 2021. They sang the national anthem on a\nprison phone line, and the track was edited together with a recording of Donald\nTrump reciting the US pledge of allegiance.\nDonald Trump played the track at some of his rallies, and proceeds\nfrom sales were donated to families of the rioters.\nPatel was involved in\npromoting the song on podcasts and websites, but today he has tried to distance himself from the project. He emphasises that he didn’t make any money from the song.\nPatel says he opposes violence against law enforcement - but his promotion of the song, and his deflecting of questions related to Trump’s pardons of the rioters, has led to some testy exchanges.\nIt's worth noting that at least half a dozen of the anonymous choir members were\nlater identified as being convicted of assaulting police officers during the\nCapitol riot.\nThere is said to be some uneasiness among Republican senators tasked with considering Gabbard's nomination.\nTwo sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Gabbard's nomination could be blocked. They described the situation as \"fluid\".\nThe sources said Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Susan Collins of Maine are among Republicans concerned about her nomination.\nGabbard can't afford to lose Republican votes on the panel to advance her nomination. Collins is on the intelligence committee and she said on Wednesday she was undecided.\nUS Senator Mitch McConnell\nSenator Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, says Patel is \"very skillful\" in his responses on the 2020 election - and he's not being complimentary.\nWelch presses Patel a number of times to say whether Biden won that vote.\nThe senator says he himself can admit that Trump won the election in 2024, but he says Patel continues to avoid stating that Biden was the winner four years ago.\n\"As I've said before,\" replies Patel, \"President Biden was certified and sworn in, and he was a president. I don't know how else to say it.\"\nKash Patel is questioned about Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the FBI and others to surveil people outside the US.\nHe's being pressed about comments he made on a podcast last year where he said Republicans \"bent the knee\" when they re-authorised the warrantless surveillance statute.\n\"Which is your opinion on the most recent re-authorisation of 702?\" Patel is asked. \"That  Republicans 'bent the knee' for not insisting or adopting significant reforms, or that reforms have gone a long way?\"\nPatel says: \"I'm proud of the reforms that have been implemented, and I'm proud to work with Congress moving forward to implement more reforms.\"\nTulsi Gabbard, nominated to lead the US intelligence community, was also questioned today about Section 702.\nMike WendlingUS digital reporter\nBack at Patel's hearing, several Republican senators who support The FBI director nominee's confirmation are\nbringing up what they call unfair targeting of certain groups for investigation.\n“They’ve enjoyed targeting Catholics. They’ve enjoyed\ntargeting parents,” says Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn. “But the American people\nhave said they want no more of that.”\nThe senators are referencing FBI and justice department\nmemos which warned of extremism from “radical-traditionalist” Catholics and people\nthreatening school officials over material which some conservatives view as too\n“woke”.\nThere are documented cases of people in both categories committing\ncriminal offenses, and the agencies have denied blanket targeting of Catholics\nor parents. They say they investigate people for their actions, not their\nbeliefs.\nBut in some quarters the memos have been held up as evidence\nof politically biased targeting.\nRepublican senators are trying to make the\npoint – one that Patel enthusiastically agrees with – that resources are better\nspent targeting drug dealers and foreign terrorists rather than homegrown right-wing\nextremists.\nTulsi Gabbard's public hearing is over. So what next for the director of national intelligence nominee?\nAs she was nominated to be America's top spy, the Senate's Intelligence Committee will decide whether to advance her confirmation.\nIf the secretive panel of nine Republicans and eight Democrats approves her nomination, it will move to the full Senate to vote on whether she takes on the post. Gabbard cannot afford to lose a single Republican vote on the panel or three Republicans in the full Senate.\nShe faces a fair amount of scepticism from Democrats and to a lesser degree among Republicans, considering her past statements about US adversaries, support for NSA whisteblower Edward Snowden and her lack of background in intelligence.\nPhil McCauslandReporting from New York\nEdward Snowden, Bashar al-Assad, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the future of American surveillance cast a huge shadow in Tulsi Gabbard's confirmation hearing to serve as Trump's director of national intelligence.\nThough senators' public questioning of Gabbard lasted just short of three hours before it went behind closed doors.\nThe former Democratic congresswoman deftly navigated many challenging questions about intelligence gathering and the workforce she will be leading - many of her answers were clearly polished by her time as a TV political commentator.\nBut several of her views clearly sparked concern and tense exchanges with Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nMembers of both parties drew focus to her defence of Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower who leaked millions of classified documents. Republicans and Democrats asked her multiple times whether she considered Snowden - someone who she has previously argued should be pardoned for his crimes - a traitor to the US.\nGabbard dug in her heels on the matter, refusing to answer and making the moment uneasy for several Republicans. Other exchanges on her assessment of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons, her decision to travel to Syria, and changing views on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, also drew raised eyebrows from the panel.\nGabbard's nomination was one that many believed could be derailed because of her past. Remember, she cannot afford to lose a single Republican vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Five Thai farm workers who were abducted during the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel have been released after being held for almost 500 days in Gaza.\nThey were handed over to the Red Crossduring chaotic scenes along with two Israelis, shortly after a first Israeli hostage was freed.\nPongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao had all been working in southern Israel when they were kidnapped during the attacks in October 2023.\nThailand's prime minister said she was elated to hear news of their release and her government was working with Israel \"so that they can reunite with their families soonest\". One Thai hostage remains unaccounted for.\n\"The Thai government, including everyone here in Thailand, have long been waiting for this very moment,\" PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra posted on social media.\n\"I hold on to my hope that the remaining Thai national will be released and returned to us safely and speedily.\"\nFor the families of the released hostages, it was a day they had long been waiting for.\nWilas Thaenna wept after receiving a call to say his son Pongsak had been freed on Thursday.\n\"I never thought this day would come, everything has been too quiet for a while,\" the 65-year-old told the BBC.\nHe revealed he had barely slept the night before, as he was so excited at the prospect of his son being released.\n\"I don't know how to explain how I got through all that happened,\" he continued.\n\"My son was taken captive, I lost my wife, I had to stay strong.\n\"First five or six months, I've lost so much weight. It was distressing, I didn't have strength to do anything or go anywhere. I was worried all the time.\n\"When I see him, I'm going to give him a hug and tell him to come home.\"\nWiwwaew Sriaoun also sobbed as it was confirmed her son Watchara had been released.\n\"The first thing I want to do is to hug my son and tell him I miss him very much,\" she said. \"His daughter, Nudee, was also happy. She has been praying every day for her daddy to return.\"\nShe said all of Watchara's relatives have come to her home in Udon Thani province to closely monitor the news.\n\"I've had hopes but I also lost hopes several times already,\" she said, adding she received a call on Wednesday night but wasn't sure if her son would still be alive. She too was unable to sleep, revealing to AFP news agency she and her husband had gone rubber tapping on their farm in the early hours of the morning.\nSirinna Suwannakham, the younger sister of freed hostage Sathian, said her family had only managed to keep the hope alive because they had no proof he had been killed.\n\"If he had died, we would have had a body to hold a ceremony,\" she said. \"But there was none. So we never lost hope. We always believed that my brother was still alive. We never gave up. We always waited for him to come home.\"\nThe released hostages were taken to hospital in Israel, after being met by Thai government officials. They are expected to return to Thailand within 10 days.\nThirty-one Thai workers were taken hostage in the October 2023 attacks, the Thai government has said previously. More than 40 were killed on the day.\nThe majority were released in November 2023, leaving just eight in Gaza, according to officials. It is believed two have since died, while the fate of the final hostage - Nattapong Pinta - is not known.\nNearly all of the foreign workers abducted during the attack were Thais. Israel employs some 30,000 of them as farm labour, making them one of the largest migrant groups in the country.\nThe release is part of a separate agreement between Hamas and the Thai government - it's not part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal agreed on 19 January.\nIndia has more than 3,600 tigers – or 75% of the global tiger population despite high human density.\nHoshoryu, real name Sugarragchaa Byambasuren, became the 74th yokozuna after winning a major tournament last week.\nAt least 30 people died and several were injured in a crush at the religious festival in India this week.\nLee Francis says he \"sheds a tear every day\" but is staying positive a year after a serious crash.\nLee Francis \"can't come to terms\" with how his day-to-day routine changed since the motorbike crash.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "\"Motorhead are the hardest, loudest band in the world – why wouldn't you make those your heroes? We're from Stoke-on-Trent and Lemmy's one of us.\"\nThose are the words of sculptor Andy Edwards who has created a statue of the band's frontman, which will be unveiled in the town of his birth on 8 May.\nLemmy was born Ian Kilmister in Burslem, in 1945 and his family later moved to Newcastle-under-Lyme. Hedied in 2015, aged 70.\nThe rocker's connection to north Staffordshire has endured among locals. And some of Lemmy's ashes will be interred within the statue's plinth by guitarist Phil Campbell.\n\"Lemmy was a personal hero to me,\" Mr Edwards said.\nHe first saw the band play live at Hanley's Victoria Hall in 1979, shortly after a school friend had told him to listen to their album Overkill.\nIt is a photo of Lemmy on the album's back cover on which the new statue has been modelled.\nMr Edwards – who is perhaps best known for his statues of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor at Derby County FC and The Beatles on Liverpool's Pier Head – said the idea for the Lemmy statue began about three years ago.\nHe added Motorhead's management had subsequently been in touch and said it would cover the cost.\nMr Edwards also saw the band at Vale Park in 1981, and described this era as their peak.\n\"The reason for making this statue is to give other people that pleasure that I've had in thinking back, those memories at Victoria Hall, Bingley Hall and Vale Park,\" he said.\nMr Edwards explained he had contemplated every intricate detail possible whilst creating the statue. This included recreating, as accurately as possible, Lemmy's Rickenbacker 4001 guitar which he was playing at Vale Park.\n\"I put those details in because if you don't, people sense there's something not quite right and they don't hang around as long,\" he said.\n\"You want people to hang about because you want people to go back in time and get their imaginations going.\"\nThe sculptor added he had even debated with himself whether to put the star in Wrangler or Levi's jeans.\nHe said he had combined details with his own memories of Lemmy's swagger, to help get the pose right.\n\"You've got to care about it, it's got to come from the heart,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.\nProsecutors file an amended list of charges against the star, saying he coerced more women into sex.\nThe concert, which also featured Dr Dre and Pink, took place to help raise funds to rebuild the LA area.\nColdplay has donated to a charity to allow young musicians to use a professional music studio.\nThe council says it would make the city a \"global leader in quality music\".\nA Belfast based choir is one of four shortlisted for a prestigious UK award.",

Yum!\nApparently the flies are pretty tricky models to work with: \"They are quite skittish and usually fly away before you can get close enough for a good shot.\n\"I spotted this particular fly on a hot, sunny day and initially struggled to approach it.\n\"However, I noticed it had prey, and since I had long hoped to capture a robber fly with prey, I kept trying. Eventually, the fly allowed me to get within range,\" Alexis said.\nThe fungus on its back is a type of parasite - an organism that needs to feed off another living thing in order to survive\nAlexis also nabbed the third place spot with their photo, Pandora.\nIt shows a small round insect called a globular springtail - so named because they jump to avoid predators - infected by a fungus.\nUsually when the insect is infected in this way their head curls underneath themselves, making them less interesting to photograph.\n\"However, when I spotted this one after rolling over a log, I knew it was special\", Alexis said, as the head was fully visible.\nThe fungus, called Pandora deplphacis, is a species about which not much is known.\nThis was captured first thing in the morning in a river meadow in Germany\nEach category has a number of runner-ups, too. This is called On Fire, and you can see why - just look at those colours!\nIt's by 17-year-old Lina from Germany, and shows two banded demoiselles which are a flying insect similar to dragonflies.\nHarvest mice live in farms and woodland areas\nAnd this adorable harvest mouse was captured by eight-year-old Jamie from the UK.\nHe was over the moon to get a shot of something so cute: \"I love the way this little mouse looks like it's peeping through wheat curtains with a curious look on its face.\"\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "White House rescinds memo on freezing federal grants and loans",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The White House says it has rescinded a memo authorising a federal freeze on hundreds of billions of dollars in grants and loans, which sparked widespread panic among millions of people who rely on government aid.\nIt comes after a judge temporarily halted the order on Tuesday, only hours after it was signed by President Donald Trump and the memo announcing it was issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\nThe judge paused the order until next Monday, after a lawsuit was filed by a group of organisations representing grant recipients.\nThe new letter issued on Wednesday states\"OMB Memorandum M-25-13 is rescinded.\"\nIt is unclear what prompted the apparent U-turn.\nIn a statement, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was still pursuing a freeze.\n\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo,\" she said. \"Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\"\nThe BBC has asked the White House to clarify how it plans to continue in light of Trump's decision to rescind the memo as well as the judge's injunction.\nEarlier this week, the acting head of the White House budget office had instructed agencies to \"temporarily pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all federal financial assistance\".\nThe office said the move was intended to give the new administration time to assess what grants and loans were in step with their agenda.\nBut the order prompted widespread confusion about which agencies and programmes would be impacted. An online portal used to access federal funds was briefly taken offline and aid groups warned about a suspension in services.\nIn response to the latest development, Democrats abruptly shifted a news conference scheduled for Tuesday on the subject of Trump's move to end birthright citizenship to one condemning the decision to freeze all federal funding instead.\n\"What they're basically doing is being lawless - to hurt families, to help their billionaire friends,\" Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after the order was rescinded.\nHe added that Republicans will continue to attempt to block future funding, and were only stopped this time due to an \"outcry\" from the public.\n\"I don't think this would have happened, except for the outcry throughout America. And we in the Senate are working with our constituents to show that outcry. We're going to keep fighting,\" he added.\nSchumer also said that Trump should next rescind his nominee to lead the OMB.\nThe order was one of several Trump has issued since taking office, aimed at cutting the size of the government and slashing federal spending. Other orders target transgender rights and the automatic citizenship granted to anyone born in the US.\nAlso on Tuesday, the Trump administration offered federal workers an option to resign and continue to receive pay for eight months, in an effort to further reduce the size of the federal workforce.\nOn Tuesday, Leavitt had said the halt in funding would allow governments to cut back spending for \"woke\" gender issues and diversity programmes.\nSeveral states had reported issues accessing funds through Medicaid, a government health insurance programme for low-income people. The White House later said the programme would not be affected.\nIt also said Social Security benefits would not be affected, nor would any programme \"that provides direct benefits to individuals\", including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps.\nAlthough the order has been blocked for now, the White House believes that the original memo served its purpose by prompting federal agencies to take steps to comply with the president's executive order.\n\"We are glad that this memo has been rescinded. The chaos unleashed by the uncertainty and lack of adequate notice yesterday should never have happened,\" said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of National Council of Nonprofits - one of the groups suing the White House over the order.\n\"Nonprofit organizations throughout the country and the people they serve can breathe a sigh of relief now that the White House has, at least for now, backed off its reckless and harmful plan to halt all federal funding for critical programs from homelessness and housing assistance, to disaster relief and rebuilding, to rape crisis centers and suicide hotlines,\" her statement on Wednesday added.\nIn an earlier press conference on Tuesday, Ms Yentel said that if implemented, the order would severely impact food and housing programmes for military veterans, shelters for survivors of domestic violence, childcare assistance.\nBernd Debusmann Jr contributed to this report\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe concert, which also featured Dr Dre and Pink, took place to help raise funds to rebuild the LA area.\nThe collision between a passenger plane and a military helicopter is suspected to have killed all 67 onboard.",

    "text": "This video can not be played\n'It's a business, money talks!' - will Aston Villa sell Duran and Watkins?\nAston Villa have rejected an approach from Arsenal for England striker Ollie Watkins.\nSources confirmed to BBC Sport the Gunners made their enquiry for the 29-year-old on Monday.\nReports of a £60m Arsenal bid first surfaced just hours before Aston Villa's Champions League win over Celtic on Wednesday night at Villa Park.\nWatkins started and scored, but also slipped to miss a bizarre penalty in the second half.\nVilla sources say they have no intention of allowing Watkins to leave, especially with continued speculationlinking fellow striker Jhon Duranwith a move to Saudi Arabia club Al Nassr.\nSources also told BBC Sport that Villa are unhappy with the timing of the approach,  which came in the build-up to a key Champions League fixture and a week before January's transfer deadline day.\nIt is not clear if Arsenal will return with further offers before Monday's 23:00 GMT deadline.\nSpeaking after the 4-2 win over Celtic, Villa manager Unai Emery said he \"did not know\" if Duran was leaving but - referencing a reported bid from a Saudi Pro League club - he said: \"If he's leaving it's good news for us because they're paying good money and we developed him in two years\".\nOn Watkins, Emery added: \"I don't want. Every player can be in the market in case it's good for the player, the club and the team. But to get this deal we are going to be very demanding as well and Watkins is our striker.\"\nAsked about the timing of Arsenal's approach, Emery replied: \"For me it doesn't matter... it's most important how the players respond. We have a lot of speculation around the players in the squad but they're showing us they are mature and responsible.\"\nWatkins & Rogers put Villa through, Celtic in play-offs\nWatch MOTD Champions League, as play-offs and top eight take shape\n'Maybe we have to sell some players' - will Watkins or Duran leave Villa?\nThis video can not be played\nWatkins restores Aston Villa's lead against Celtic\nWatkins has 11 goals in 32 games this season and scored the equaliser in Villa's 2-2 draw at Emirates Stadium this month.\nThe England international has 80 goals in 200 appearances for the Midlands club sincejoining from Brentfordfor £28m in 2020.\nThe Gunners are looking for a new striker before the January transfer window closes, with Gabriel Jesus out with a serious knee injury he suffered in theFA Cup defeat by Manchester United this month.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said on Friday that the Gunners \"need some help\" in attack this season.\nHe said the club were \"actively looking\" to sign a striker who was able to \"make an impact\" after losing both Bukayo Saka and Jesus to long-term injuries.\n\"So we lack goals, we lack people, we lack options in the frontline, it's clear,\" Arteta said.\nThe Gunners are challenging for the Premier League title for the third season in a row but are six points behind Liverpool - who also have a game in hand - in the table.\nArsenal have also been linked with RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko and Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.\nThis video can not be played\nEmery discusses Duran transfer speculation\nOllie Watkins scored 19 Premier League goals in 2023-24 to fire Aston Villa into this season's Champions League\nArsenal 'actively looking' to sign striker - Arteta\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "Dominique Pelicot, who drugged and raped his then wife Gisèle and recruited dozens of men to abuse her over almost a decade, has been questioned over two other attacks dating back to the 1990s.\nThe 72-year-old Frenchman, who was jailed for 20 years in December, is being investigated over the alleged rape and murder of property agent Sophie Narme in Paris on 4 December 1991. He denies the offence.\nInvestigators also quizzed him about the attempted rape of another young property agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in a suburb of the capital on 11 May 1999.\nDuring his trial, Pelicot admitted to that offence after DNA evidence taken from blood found on Marion's shoe was linked to him.\nHowever, when he was asked about Sophie Narme during the same trial, he said he had \"nothing to do\" with the killing.\nInvestigators have previously pointed to similarities between the two cases.\nIn the 1991 murder, the victim was attacked by a man who used a false name to book a viewing for an apartment. Detectives say Pelicot did the same in 1999.\nThe smell of the anaesthetic drug ether was detected by police at the 1991 crime scene. Police say it was also used in the 1999 attack do subdue the victim.\nThe two cases were grouped together in September 2022 and have been investigated by a team which specialises in unsolved cases and serial crimes.\nPelicot was placed under formal investigation in October 2022 over both crimes.\nThecriminal case against Pelicot and the 49 other menaccused of raping Gisèle  lasted for three months and was France's largest ever rape trial.\nBy the time it ended, she had become a national figure and wasmet by crowds of hundreds of people chanting her nameoutside court.\nHer decision to make the trial public has generated renewed conversations around rape, consent and gender violence in France.\nThe biggest names in fashion unveil their new collections, with a host of celebrities on hand.\nTwo separate avalanches killed four Norwegians and one Swiss skier.\nThe Brazilian-Portuguese national was found dead by mountain rescuers.\nFrance's president says a second museum entrance will be built, while non-EU residents will also pay more to visit.\nThe missing 73-year-old set off his distress beacon during stormy weather on Saturday.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Retail crime is \"out of control\" and shoplifters are carrying out increasingly brazen and violent acts of theft because they do not fear any consequences, an industry body has told the BBC.\nIn some cases, offenders are openly clearing shelves of items in full view of customers and shop workers - a tactic sometimes known as \"kamikaze\" shoplifting.\nIn the 12 months to September last year, incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers £2bn.\nThe figures were published on Thursday in the annual crime survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents more than 200 major retailers.\nAccording to the BRC, violence and abuse against shopworkers also rose by 50%, with more than 2,000 such incidents recorded on average per day.\nIt says its survey was based on a sample of retailers representing over 1.1 million employees and a market turnover of more than £194bn.\nSeparate figures published by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period.\nThat is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003.\nHowever Tom Holder, spokesperson for the BRC, said the extent of the problem is \"very, very much underestimated by the ONS\", because it only captures crime reported by police.\n\"If their statistics were true, there'd only be about one and a half incidents per year per shop, and if you ask any shopkeeper they'll tell you they're lucky if a day goes by where there hasn't been a shoplifting incident.\"\nIn one \"kamikaze\" incident last month at a phone store in London's Oxford Street, two men spent minutes kicking down a phone stand in front of customers and shop workers.\nIt is believed the phone stand contained dummy phones which could then have been sold online to unsuspecting customers, tricked into believing they were buying the real thing.\nThe Metropolitan Police said officers responded to the incident and carried out a search of the area. They were unable to locate the suspects, despite the fact that they were captured on video. An investigation has since been launched.\nShoplifting is often driven by organised gangs and prolific offenders stealing to order, according to Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive.\nShe said offenders were becoming more daring because \"they don't see that there's necessarily any consequences\".\n\"It's outrageous and out of control in many parts of the country.\"\nSocial media is filled with videos of shoplifting, sometimes in front of shop workers and security officers who do not appear to step in.\nMs Dickinson said shop staff are often advised not to intervene because they run a risk of being attacked.\nAndrew Goodacre, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association, said he was \"not surprised\" by the figures.\n\"The harsh reality of this is this is only the tip of the iceberg. We've been encouraging our members to report the incidents but a lot of them just don't bother reporting because historically they've had no response.\n\"So there's still a huge gap between the crimes being committed and the report to the police.\"\nShop owner Amit Puntambekar said he was punched in the face by a young woman he suspected of stealing £75 worth of vapes from his Cambridgeshire store earlier this year.\nHe believes the number of violent incidents has worsened over the past three years and has made him consider quitting the business, which has been in his family for nearly 40 years.\n\"I don't want to die at work,\" he said. \"When your staff are threatened with a hammer, when someone threatens to kill you who lives near your shop and the police don't take it seriously, what's the point?”\nCriminals know the law is soft on shoplifting, Mr Puntambekar believes, so suspects are carrying out crimes in plain sight.\nCambridgeshire Police said a 17-year-old girl has been charged with common assault and theft from a shop following the incident and will appear in court on 5 February.\nFacilities management firm Mitie supplies 10,000 security guards to the UK retail sector. It said 10% of these were injured in the line of duty in 2024.\nAccording to its security director, Jason Towse, shoplifters have become more fearless because police resources have become more focused on \"high-profile\" crime.\n\"The main issue for why people are using that 'kamikaze' approach is to scare colleagues and scare the staff,\" he said. \"They also know that the response from the police is not what it used to be.\"\nSecurity guards do not have more powers than other citizens to apprehend shoplifters. But Mr Towse says they are trained in how best to identify and respond to issues. They can also act as a visible deterrent and share data and evidence with the police.\nWe asked 10 major retailers what their staff policies were for dealing with shoplifters carrying out violent or aggressive theft.\nSeveral said the safety of staff and customers was a priority, and added that they had invested in security measures including CCTV, body-worn cameras, and an increase in security guards.\nShoplifting adds £133 to the cost of an average UK household's shopping bill each year, according to the Centre for Retail Research.\nIn 2023, the government launched a scheme that set out guidance for police on tackling the issue – including prioritising attending violent incidents or where an offender has been caught.\nProject Pegasus - an intelligence-sharing partnership between retailers and policing - was also set up to focus on tackling shoplifting gangs and prolific offenders.\nIn response to the BRC survey, Home Office Minister Dame Diana Johnson has called the rise in shop crime \"utterly unacceptable\".\nShe has also repeated a government pledge to bring in a new specific offence for assaulting retail workers – something the retail industry has been calling for since 2020.\nIt would help clarify the size of the problem and allow statistics to be collected, says the BRC.\nHelen Dickinson says the latest record levels of shoplifting should serve as a \"wake-up call\" to the government and the police.\n\"The fear of consequence is just not there and I think that's why we need to see more resources and more focus by the police,\" she says.\nJason Towse says there is more work to do but thinks that steps being taken across the industry are starting to bring about results.\n\"Ultimately when shoplifters start to see the levels of consequence more and more than we're seeing today… that will really change the tide.\"",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Rail fares across Scotland are set to increase by 3.8% in April.\nThe price rise, instigated by Transport Scotland, will affect all services operated by ScotRail. It means an anytime return ticket between Glasgow and Edinburgh will rise by £1.20 - from £31.40 to £32.60.\nTransport Scotland said Scottish government ministers agreed on the increase - which follows an 8.7% rise last year - after \"lengthy consideration\" to ensure rail services are sustainable long-term and in line with the budget.\nOpposition parties said the price rise would \"hammer\" passengers who would be \"dismayed\" at having to pay more despite regular disruption to rail services.\nTransport Scotland said a 20% discount on season tickets would continue until September and the travel card Flexipass - which offers 12 single journeys for the price of 10 - has been expanded to cover more stations.\nThese include Exhibition Centre (Glasgow), Anderston, Motherwell, High Street (Glasgow), Charing Cross (Glasgow), Perth, Stirling, and Bathgate.\nTransport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: \"We know that any increase is unwelcome for passengers, therefore we have kept the rise as low as possible to maintain the attractiveness and affordability of rail as a travel option.\n\"We continue to look at ways to encourage greater rail use and that is why we are continuing our 20% discounts on season tickets until September 2025 as planned and expanding the availability of Flexipass.\n\"ScotRail also continue to develop fares initiatives which can help attract more passengers, while offering savings and added value to existing rail users.\"\nScottish Labour's transport spokeswoman Claire Baker said the price increase would \"hammer\" rail passengers and \"consign ScotRail to a spiral of decline\".\nShe added: \"The SNP should be making rail more affordable, but instead it has hit passengers with painful fare hikes time and time again.\n\"This increase is bad for Scotland's rail passengers, bad for our economy and bad for the environment.\"\nSue Webber, transport spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservatives, said: \"Nicola Sturgeon promised a bright new future for Scotland's railways when nationalising it almost three years ago, but the exact opposite has happened.\n\"Passengers will be dismayed they will have to fork out even more in the coming months for services that are frequently cancelled and delayed.\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats urged the government to keep costs down and give passengers more flexibility.\nThe party's transport spokesman Daniel O'Malley called for more railway lines in areas with poor transport links.\n\"Scotland needs a cheap, reliable and frequent rail service - it's a win-win for passengers and the planet,\" he said.\nThe Scottish Greens' transport spokesman Mark Ruskell said rail travel needed to be \"affordable and accessible\" in order for people to choose it over cars.\nHe added: \"When the Scottish Greens were in government we secured the removal of peak rail fares, only for the SNP to bring them back as soon as we were out of the room.\n\"If we want safer and cleaner communities and less cars on our roads, then we need to cut the cost of public transport.\"\nIn October 2023, ScotRail launched a pilot scheme which scrapped peak rail fares to encourage people to use the railway rather than their cars, but it ended in September 2024 following \"limited success\".\nPeak fares cover tickets bought before 09:15 on weekdays and certain services between 16:42 and 18:30.\nTransport Scotland said the scheme, which saw ticket prices subsidised by the Scottish government and standardised across the day, \"did not achieve its aims\" of persuading more people to swap car journeys for rail travel.\nPassenger levels increased by a maximum of around 6.8% but the scheme required a 10% rise to be self-financing.\nThe move to scrap the scheme was criticised by opposition MSPs, with Labour calling peak fares \"a tax on workers trying to travel to work in a more sustainable way\".\nPolice say the family of Henrietta Huszti has been informed and the search for her sister Eliza continues.\nThe chancellor announces projects in England's south as infrastructure in the North East crumbles.\nA selection of photographs submitted to BBC Scotland News from around the country this week.\nJohn Swinney calling for a minimum council tax rise and £53m spent on failed Rangers takeover court cases make the front pages.\nA selection of photographs submitted to BBC Scotland News from around the country this week.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's controversial 2017 meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and past statements on Russia's invasion of Ukraine have drawn fresh scrutiny after President-elect Donald Trump picked her to oversee America's spy agencies.\nOn Thursday, she will face questioning from senators in Washington who will later vote on her confirmation.\nIf confirmed as US director of national intelligence (DNI), Gabbard would act as a steward of the nation's most important secrets, oversee 18 US spy agencies and serve as a close adviser to the president.\nBut former US national security officials and lawmakers have raised concerns that the choice of Gabbard - a fierce opponent of America's involvement in foreign wars and whom critics accuse of echoing Kremlin narratives - could negatively affect intelligence co-operation.\nLewis Lukens, a retired diplomat who served as the deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London during the first Trump administration, told the BBC that Gabbard's \"dubious judgement\" could give allies \"reason to question how safe it is to share intelligence with the US\".\nGabbard, who recently joined the Republican Party, has previously said her detractors are \"warmongers\" who seek to smear any critic of Washington's establishment.\nTrump has also defended his pick, saying that Gabbard -  a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve who deployed to Iraq and Kuwait  - “will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community”.\nBut in an odd twist for a DNI appointment, Russian state media praised the Gabbard choice, which only added to the alarm among national security officials in the US capital.\nProminent talk show host Olga Skabeyeva said on 14 November that \"virtually from the first days of Russia's special operation in Ukraine, she [Gabbard] explained its reasons, criticised the actions of the Biden administration, and also personally met none other than Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and supported his fight against terrorists.\"\nFor as long as she has been in politics, Gabbard's positions have earned her praise and scorn from Democrats and Republicans alike.\nHer views have been generally anti-war, opposed to American intervention and deeply critical of the US intelligence community.\nBut it was her January 2017 \"fact-finding\" trip to Syria as a congresswoman that first sparked outrage - particularly whenshe later raised doubtabout the US intelligence assessment that Assad's forces had used chemical weapons on civilians.\nAfter the Trump administration launched a series of strikes on Syria in April that year following a chemical attack that killed more than 80 people, Gabbard called the strikes \"reckless and short-sighted\", saying they would escalate the civil war and hamper the collection of evidence about what had happened.\nThe US launched missiles at a Syrian Air Force base where the Pentagon said a warplane had taken off before dropping bombs filled with the nerve agent sarin on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun.\nA UN panel later came to the same conclusion as the US, saying it was confident that the Syrian government was responsible for the release of sarin in the town.\nAssad's government and its ally Russia rejected the report and alleged that the Syrian Air Force strike hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions.\nGabbard's comments, and her controversial meeting with Assad, hung over her run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019.\nDefending her actions, she told an interviewer that Assad, who is also backed by Iran, was \"not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States\".\nThe Trump transition team has not responded to a request for comment from the BBC.\nShe drew further attention during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when she made statements seen by some as echoing Putin's justifications for the war.\nGabbard said that the war could have been avoided if the Biden administration and the Nato military alliance \"had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns\" about Ukraine eventually becoming a member.\nWeeks later, she released a video commenting that US-funded biolabs in Ukraine could be breached and \"release and spread deadly pathogens\". It cameas Russia, defending its invasion, spread unevidenced claimsthat the US was helping Ukraine to develop biological weapons.\nIn response, Republican Senator Mitt Romney posted on social media that Gabbard was \"parroting false Russian propaganda\" and spreading \"treasonous lies\". Gabbard sent a cease-and-desist letter to Romney over his remarks.\nAnd during the 2024 presidential campaign, Gabbard alleged that Vice-President Kamala Harris was the \"main instigator\" of the conflict in Ukraine for having supported Kyiv's Nato aspirations.\nNikki Haley, Trump's UN ambassador during his first term and a politician who challenged him for the Republican nomination in the 2024 election, said recently that Gabbard could not be entrusted with such a high-level intelligence role.\n“This is not a place for a Russian, Iranian, Syrian, Chinese sympathiser,” Haley said.\nSome worry that Gabbard taking the position could affect trust between US intelligence agencies and their foreign counterparts.\nA former senior White House official said Gabbard's appointment could have \"real effects on our ability to have intelligence diplomacy with close allies\".\n\"It certainly will raise real questions in the minds of foreign counterparts if the person sitting across from them - Tulsi Gabbard - has fundamentally differing assumptions about Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin,\" the official told the BBC.\nA former Nato official in London echoed that concern, saying that Gabbard's nomination would raise serious questions about how the UK and other American allies approach the US intelligence community under Trump.\n\"I think there's an extreme level of discomfort because why would you appoint somebody who has got no background and wacky views to such a responsible position?\"  the former official said.\nBut others did not expect any change to their country's intelligence relationship with the US.\nDuncan Lewis led Australia's domestic spy agency - the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation - through the early years of the first Trump administration. He said he did not know Gabbard, but stressed that the Australian-American alliance was more powerful than any individual.\n\"Our bilateral security relationship is strong and long-standing, and I expect that to continue,\" he told the BBC.\nEach morning the DNI oversees what is included in the president's daily briefing, giving them power to shape the US leader's perceptions of the world and its threats.\nThat is something that US senators will keep in mind when they consider Gabbard's nomination, and that is what could make her Senate confirmation process contentious.\nElissa Slotkin, a former CIA officer and Democrat who served with Gabbard in the House of Representatives, told media outlet Puck that Trump's DNI nominee \"has expressed views that seem to preference adversaries\".\n\"Certainly, it gave me pause, when I heard the nomination,\" added Slotkin, who will vote on Gabbard's confirmation as a newly-elected Michigan senator.\nJames Lankford, a Republican who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee,  has said that he and other senators will have many questions about Gabbard's past comments, and the Assad meeting.\nBut another Republican senator, Eric Schmitt of Missouri, said some of the criticism of Gabbard from Democratic colleagues - including that she was \"compromised\" - had been \"totally ridiculous\".\n“It’s insulting. It’s a slur, quite frankly. There’s no evidence that she’s a asset of another country,” he told NBC.\nAnd Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin said that Gabbard was a \"solid choice\", whom allies would find \"extremely capable\".\n\"There’s some questions on the Republican side; there’s some questions on the Democrat side,\" he told the BBC.\n\"What I’ve been telling everybody is just sit down and talk to her.\"\nAdditional reporting by Francis Scarr, BBC Monitoring\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK cansign up here. Those outside the UK cansign up here.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of responses.\nThe president started his White House news conference as \"consoler-in-chief\" but then pivoted into unevidenced political blame, writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.\nThe president also suggested he still plans to impose new tariffs on China but did not give any details.\nTrump's two cabinet nominees were grilled on their ties to Capitol rioters and past comments.\nTrump's plan to cut foreign aid will make it harder for Kurdish authorities to secure Syria's camps and prisons.",

    "text": "Welsh farmers are to be banned from disposing of waste sheep dip on their land, over concerns the liquid chemical treatment is polluting rivers.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said it had measured increased levels of diazinon - a chemical which is highly toxic to aquatic life - accumulating in rivers.\nIt intends to phase out the decades-old practice of allowing farms to spread diluted waste dip to land, and will stop issuing new permits.\nBut farming union NFU Cymru said it was \"shocked\" and \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision, calling for it to be overturned.\nSheep dip is a chemical solution used to treat sheep for parasites and skin conditions.\nWhile sheep dipping is \"important to safeguard livestock\", NRW said changes were needed to dispose of the leftover liquid.\nPermits allowing farmers to spread it on their land will no longer be issued.\nFarms will now be required to employ a registered waste carrier to dispose of their waste dip \"in a suitable waste facility\", NRW said.\nThose with an active permit will be allowed to carry on spreading on land \"for the time being\", although \"eventually all waste dip will need to be disposed of this way\", the regulator added.\nSimon Evans, chief executive officer of the Wye and Usk Foundation, said diazinon was \"a very dangerous chemical for the environment\" which had proven effects on fish such as salmon and trout.\n\"We're finding it in the Usk at levels of concern in autumn, which is when the fish are trying to spawn,\" he said.\n\"The only real use for it anymore is for sheep dips and that means the current disposal system is not working.\"\n\"We support NRW's position because something has to be done,\" he added.\nBut NFU Cymru livestock board chairman Rob Lewis said the union was \"shocked that NRW has taken this decision with immediate effect\", pointing out that \"new applications for permits are still available elsewhere in the UK\".\n\"The practice of sheep dipping in Wales is integral to maintain the high flock health status of the Welsh flock,\" he added.\n\"The decision has implications for animal health and welfare, the ongoing management of key habitats and disadvantages young farmers and new entrants to the sheep sector.\"\n\"We have written to NRW today and called for the decision to be reversed.\"\nThe union's rural affairs board chairman Hedd Pugh said Wales was \"nowhere near getting a workable spent dip disposal scheme\" up and running.\n\"There are issues around actual collection and storage but more importantly, the end point and the uneconomic cost of incineration of spent dip,\" he said.\nGail Davies-Walsh, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru said rivers trusts had been \"expressing concerns about the disposal of diazinon to land for some time\" so the announcement was \"good news\".\n\"It is worth noting that there are currently no disposal facilities for the chemical in Wales, so farmers will need better support to deal with it,\" she added.\nNadia De Longhi of NRW said it was \"constantly working to balance the needs of working farms with our duties to safeguard the environment\".\n\"Disposing of sheep dip to land has been done for more than 30 years but we've noticed a negative effect accumulating in our rivers that is causing us to fail to meet the standards required to protect the water environment,\" she said.\n\"This is why we've decided to phase out the practice as there are now better alternatives available.\"\nNRW is encouraging farmers to surrender permits they no longer need, and has removed a £363 charge for doing so.\nAndrew Muir outlines plans for the Sustainable Agriculture Programme, formerly the Farm Support and Development Programme.\nFind out how much you will pay using the BBC's calculator.\nScotland is \"unlikely\" to meet its 2030 climate change target to reduce car use, according to public spending watchdogs.\nPlans for the UK's largest hydrogen storage caverns have been relocated from Portland to land near Weymouth.\nResidents living near the Hafod tip say the odours coming from the site smell like rotten eggs.",

How do players prepare for Test match rugby?\nFormer Scotland captain Fraser Brown competed in multiple Six Nations and gave BBC Scotland an insight into what will be going on in camp before Gregor Townsend's side take on Italy at Murrayfield on Saturday.\nYou are Townsend... who makes your Scotland XV?\nBig names 'need to really shine' for injury-hit Scotland\nHow to follow 2025 Six Nations across the BBC\nBreakfast is the most important meal of the day, as the old adage goes, so what does an international rugby player eat to fuel up for a hard day's training?\n\"The spread's usually quite good these days, so kind of whatever you want,\" said Brown, who played 61 times for Scotland between 2013 and 2023.\n\"There's cereal, there'll be poached eggs, scrambled eggs, omelettes made to order. I think Zander Fagerson usually takes all of the above.\n\"It's just what you usually have. If you're usually a big breakfast guy, you have a big breakfast. If you have a coffee and some toast, you'll have some coffee and toast.\n\"You'll probably catch up with your calories for the rest of the day. Then it swings a little bit more towards matchday prep as you get towards the end of the week.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDrama, despair & smelly socks - pundits relive Six Nations days\nLegendary Scotland and Lions coach Jim Telfer famously used to flog his players in training to get them battle-hardened for the demands of Test match rugby.\nThe days of endless scrummaging practice and ferocious rucking sessions leading up to a game are a thing of the past, so what does a training week look like for a modern-day player ahead of a Six Nations opener?\n\"Monday's usually quite light, and then Tuesday and Wednesday will be heavy days,\" Brown explained. \"Then it's just nice and light towards the end of the week.\n\"But from a psychological point of view, it will completely switch. There'll be lots of learning at the start of the week. Then as you taper down your training and you get more time off your feet, then the anticipation towards gameday builds.\"\nWhereas those outside the inner sanctum only discover the matchday squad later in the week, players get a sense of who has got the nod days before.\n\"Normally on a Monday, there'd be a walkthrough and you tend to get bibs handed out to those that are in the team,\" Brown said. \"So you can kind of figure it out then.\n\"Officially on a Tuesday morning, there's usually a team presentation. Then at the end of that, there'll be a little video that goes up with the 23 on it and then a little round of applause, some handshakes and pats on the back.\n\"In every team, most people call it Test Match Tuesday. So normally after the team has been announced, there's then a bit of full contact through either units or rugby sessions and Test Match Tuesday comes out.\n\"That's your opportunity to lay a marker down, say that you should have been picked, or have a cheap dig. There's always a little bit of friction.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'That was terrible!' - Six Nations captains take on reactions challenge\nLavish breakfast buffets, fancy hotels and access to top-class medical treatment - it would be easy to think the life of a rugby player is a charmed one.\nThe sacrifices are many, though. Getting clobbered by huge physical specimens on a regular basis takes its toll, for one.\nLong spells spent away from family and friends in the team bubble is another challenge, so how do the players keep themselves occupied in their down time?\n\"Some people just sit around,\" Brown said. \"We actually used to play a game we called Mafia, which most people will probably know asTraitors on BBC.\n\"It's a game that we used to play without cards. That usually lasts two or three hours. A lot of the boys play it.

    "text": "Criminal gangs are targeting newbuild estates in North Yorkshire, stealing new boilers from homes which are still being built, according to police.\nThe North Yorkshire force said in one incident in Knaresborough, earlier this month, more than 20 boilers were stolen from a building site, at a cost of around £300,000.\nThefts of this type are increasingly being seen across the country, with police in the Yorkshire region citing gangs operating along the A1(M) corridor, making newbuild locations close by particularly vulnerable.\nPolice believe the presence of several large building sites in Knaresborough, where hundreds of new homes are under development, is also a factor.\nAccording to figures from North Yorkshire Police, 68 incidents involving boiler thefts have been recorded since 2023, with almost 70% of those from newbuild sites.\nThe force said each incident might involve several stolen boilers, not just one.\nInsp Holly Nicholls, from North Yorkshire Police, said: \"In North Yorkshire, particularly in Knaresborough, we're off the A1 corridor - so we see criminals, organised crime groups, travelling from other police areas, and they are really quite professional.\n\"They'll ordinarily come and do a recce beforehand, to see which properties they can target. They're trained - so they've probably got some plumbing expertise - [and] they'll have a vehicle so they can get them out really quickly,\" she added.\nHousebuilder Linden Homes, who are building hundreds of new homes on the outskirts of Knaresborough, was targeted by boiler thieves last year.\n\"April, last year, we had 10 boilers pinched,\" site manager John McDermott told the BBC.\n\"Patio doors had been smashed through, front doors had been smashed in, and through the night they had taken 10 boilers - causing a lot of damage.\n\"It comes at a cost to us because then we have to get plumbers back in, electricians back in...\n\"Some of the kitchens got replaced,\" he added.\nAs well as the damage caused to the properties, he said, in some cases, the thefts had delayed house sales, and even caused some sales to collapse.\nThis week North Yorkshire Police launched 'Operation Thaw' - with increased patrols on the A1, alongside neighbourhood teams marking boilers with codes - using invisible ink, and an initiative to raise awareness in local communities.\nAt some sites, builders have also put trackers on new boilers, with signs in property windows warning would-be thieves.\nMartin Narby, who lives on one of the new estates in Knaresborough which has been previously targeted, was pleased to see police on patrol.\n\"We just moved here a year ago - there's a very healthy Facebook group already where people share advice, so anything which expands on that, where we can share intelligence and information, would be really helpful\".\nListen to highlights fromNorth Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look Northor tell us a story you thinkwe should be covering here.\nThe Canadian star is set to appear in a new festive-themed film but more details are under wraps.\nThe pair ripped out boilers, doors and white goods from homes in northern England, a court hears.\nPC Rosie Prior and Ryan Welford died after being struck by a lorry on the A19 at Bagby.\nMinor collision happened minutes before PC and driver were killed while standing at roadside.\nPC Rosie Prior stopped to help at a crash scene in North Yorkshire before being struck by a lorry.",

A law enforcement source speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS had earlier given a higher number of 30 bodies.\nThe American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, was approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport at around 21:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday when the two aircraft collided.\nFigure skaters from the US were among those who were on board the aeroplane. Russia has confirmed that some of its citizens were also on board.\nSeveral \"athletes, coaches and family members\" were returning from a development camp, US Figure Skating, the sport's American governing body, said in a statement.\nRussian media said the citizens on the plane were the former world champions Vadim Naumov, 55, and Evgenia Shishkova, 52, who are also married.\nThe Pentagon said the helicopter, a Sikorsky H-60, took off from Fort Belvoir in Virginia.\nAn official said it was on a training flight and belonged to B Company, 12th Aviation Battalion from Fort Belvoir in Virginia.\nMultiple federal and local agencies are involved in the search effort.\nAt the scene, the BBC observed debris believed to be from the aircraft floating in the Potomac River. US media says the aircraft split in half when it crashed into the water.\nBBC Verify confirmed both the plane and the helicopter were transmitting information about their flight paths and altitude ahead of the crash.\nThey would have used an on board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) to detect nearby flights, but Doug Rice, a retired American Airlines pilot, told broadcaster NBC these systems are not effective below 700ft (213m).\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would investigate the incident, together with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).\nEyewitnesses told local media they saw sparks and flashes when the mid-air collision happened.\nAri Schulman told NBC Washington what unfolded before him quickly changed from \"completely normal\" to \"very, very wrong\".\nHe said there was \"a stream of sparks\" underneath the jet.\nBBC Transport correspondent Sean Dilley described DC's airspace as \"intensely busy\".\nWith two major airports, heavy military traffic around the Pentagon and a Presidential airspace it is \"one of the most tightly controlled airspace in the world\", he said.\nThe city's emergency chief John Donnelly said 300 responders on rubber boats were deployed to search for survivors.\n\"There is wind, there are pieces of ice in the water...and because there is not a lot of light, you are out there searching every square inch of space,\" he said.\n\"These are very tough conditions for [rescuers] to dive in.\"\nUS President Donald Trump said he had been \"fully briefed on the terrible accident\".\n\"Thank you for the incredible work being done by our first responders. I am monitoring the situation and will provide more details as they arise,\" he said in a statement.\nHe also questioned how the incident could have happened, writing on TruthSocial that it \"should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!\"\nTakeoffs and landings have been halted at Washington National as emergency personnel respond to the incident, the airport wrote in a post on X.\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy, whose appointment was only recently confirmed said \"there will be a review of what happened here tonight\".\nHe said the government will take \"appropriate action if necessary\" to alter flight paths near Ronald Reagan airport. Flights have been diverted to Dulles International Airport, about 28 miles (45km) away.\nFederal aviation authorities and the US Congress have launched investigations into the incident.\nAmerican Airlines CEO Robert Isom expressed his \"deep sorrow\" and said the airline had sent a team to Washington DC, and he will be travelling there too.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of responses.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe president started his White House news conference as \"consoler-in-chief\" but then pivoted into unevidenced political blame, writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.\nThe concert, which also featured Dr Dre and Pink, took place to help raise funds to rebuild the LA area.\nNew drug suzetrigine, known by its brand name Journavx, has been approved to treat moderate to severe pain.",

    "text": "Netflix will release a talent show judged by One Direction star Liam Payne later this year, it has confirmed.\nBuilding the Band was one of the last projects Payne worked on before he died at the age of 31 following a fall from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina, last October.\nThe singer filmed his role as a judge in the series alongside Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland and Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger.\nNetflix has not announced a date, but confirmed the release as it revealed a raft of new TV and film content for 2025.\nBuilding the Band brings together singers seeking to form their very own band, in a concept similar to Love is Blind as they are kept in separate booths without seeing each other.\nThe show's synopsis says: \"All they have to go on is musical compatibility, connection, chemistry and merit... with incredible performances, compelling drama, and one big goal - to find the next great music band - the stage is set for an unforgettable experience.\"\nBackstreet Boys star AJ Mclean will host the series, with Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger taking on the role of mentor and judge on the show, while Payne and Rowland will appear as guest judges.\nScherzinger was a judge on The X Factor when Payne auditioned in 2010 as a solo contestant, before being grouped with Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson to form One Direction.\nPayne's former partner Cheryl, the mother to his son Bear, as well as his fellow One Direction bandmates, were among those who attended his funeral in Buckinghamshire in November.\nAn investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Argentina is continuing following his death.\nFive people have been charged over his death, including the singer's friend Roger Nores, the hotel's manager, and a receptionist – who were all accused of manslaughter.\nArgentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office previously said in a statement that a hotel employee and waiter have been charged with supplying cocaine.\nA hearing to ascertain how Payne died, held at Buckinghamshire Coroner's Court in December, has been adjourned until a pre-inquest review on 6 November.\nJodie Whittaker stars in Toxic Town, about families fighting for justice amid an environmental scandal.\nThe German shepherd, born in Herefordshire, played Brandy in three seasons of the Netflix comedy.\nJones will star opposite Cold Feet star James Nesbitt in the eight-part series.\nSquid Game 2 and live sports, including the Jake Paul v Mike Tyson fight, fuelled new memberships.\nCatherine Ayers is obsessed with darts, so missed her hit Netflix show when it was released.",

    "tags": "Scottish Premiership, Rangers, Scottish Football, Football",
    "text": "As former Rangers midfielder Scott Arfield put it, the Ibrox club and the Europa League seem to be made for each other.\nThis season, like many before it, European football's second-tier competition has been Rangers' salvation amid choppy domestic waters.\nVictory against Union Saint-Gilloise sealed an unlikely top-eight berth and safe passage to the last 16 as Rangers made it to the Europa League knockouts for a fifth consecutive time.\nAs manager Philippe Clement was keen to stress afterwards, they have done it again despite a very difficult fixture list and a raft of injuries, particularly in defence.\nHaving been under pressure for league performances, especially away from home, the Rangers boss can now point to a seriously impressive achievement this term.\n\"It's good people start to see more and more, things a few months ago people maybe didn't believe,\" Clement said.\n\"Qualification in this Europa League is one of these things. The club is on the right way. Is it fast enough to win everything? That's our ambition.\n\"We need to create this culture and more and more I see it. They know what it means to play for this club.\"\nRangers upset odds to clinch unlikely Europa League top-eight finish\nRangers' Matondo joins Hannover on loan\nMore Rangers reaction & analysis\nIt's worth emphasising just how rocky the path was for Rangers to finish in the top eight, having started the final matchday in 13th place in the standings.\nThey ended up playing four of the other seven teams who went straight to the last 16 in Manchester United, Tottenham, Lyon and Olympiakos.\nDuring the eight matches they ended up playing seven different back-four combinations due to a series of casualties.\nRight-back Neraysho Kasanwirjo played left-back against Malmo before he suffered a season-ending injury.\nLeft-back Ridvan Yilmaz had to play right-back against two Premier League sides, while James Tavernier ended up at centre-back against Manchestr United and Union.\nAt Ibrox against the Belgians, diminutive right winger Ross McCausland filled in on the right of defence after Leon King was forced off inside the first quarter with a head knock.\nIn their final two games, Rangers finished with several teenagers on the pitch.\nAll that considered, the resilience was seriously impressive as they finished eighth having only been outscored by three sides.\n\"Maybe we don't have the talent of other teams - but it's about mentality,\" Clement said. \"The belief was there from the first day but it's about digging in and giving everything we have.\n\"We had to be very creative the last few months but we've done it brilliantly.\n\"Massive clubs with massive budgets have finished behind us, and around us, the achievement is only bigger by beating four of the seven top teams.\"\nThis video can not be played\nClement praises Rangers after win\nRangers can now wait and watch next month's knockout round play-offs, knowing they will play either Bodo/Glimt, Anderlecht, Twente or Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.\nAll will pose a challenge, but none will strike fear into Rangers' hearts.\nOf the current squad, only Tavernier and Leon Balogun played a big role in their run to the final in 2022, when they suffered penalty heartbreak against Eintracht Frankfurt.\nThat shows the scale of the change at Ibrox in just a few years. However, the club seems to have muscle memory when it comes to the Europa League.\nHaving already played four of the top seven and only been outclassed by Lyon so far, and with no teams dropping down from the Champions League this year, they will fancy another deep run.\nPlus they can now add players to their squad who they did not initially register, such as Danilo and Ianis Hagi, and also wait for some of their injured players to return.\nMcCausland was asked after the match if he thinks they can go all the way.\n\"Definitely, 100%,\" was his reply.\nWhether they do or not, Rangers fans can strap themselves in for another Europa League adventure in the spring.",

    "text": "The UK has restated ambitious plans to reduce its emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases by 81% by 2035, but has not explained how it will achieve the goal.\nIn a new action plan submitted to the United Nations, the government also signed up to global goals to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.\nHowever, it has not set targets for sectors like farming, aviation, or energy to address those sectors' contributions to climate change.\nThe UN called the plans \"bold\" and told other countries to follow suit.\nThe announcement from Energy and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband comes a day after many environmentalists criticised the government's backing of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmeroriginally announced the emissions plans in November.\nAll nations which signed the United Nations' (UN) landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015 are obliged to submit climate action plans, which are called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in UN jargon, every five years.\nTogether the strategies are designed to ramp up action globally until the world reaches net zero - the point when no more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere - and keeps the global temperature rise at 1.5C.\nThe government's newNDC lists plans already announced, including a goal of producing 95% of electricity from clean energy sources by 2030.\nIt also formally signed up the UK to the global goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030.\nDr Robin Lamboll, from Imperial College London, says the UK's plan \"doesn't have any nasty surprises\", but is not \"particularly inspiring\".\nHe also said it gave a sense of \"normality\" to the Paris agreement after US President Donald Trump pledged to leave the treaty.\nSir Keir was hailed a global climate leader in November when he announced the UK's new emissions target.\nThe latest plans confirm that position, says Prof Joeri Rogelj, from Imperial College London.\nHe said it \"follows the advice of [the government's] scientific advisory committee\", but says that policies must follow, in order to fulfil the ambitious promises.\nMiliband said more details will be published soon, and that emissions from international aviation or shipping will be accounted for in plans that begin in 2033 in the Sixth Carbon Budget.\nThe Budget advises the government on the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions that can be produced between 2033 and 2037 if the UK is to fulfil its climate targets.\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell called on other countries to submit their plans, saying \"no-one can afford to miss out\".\nThe plans must be received before 10 February, ahead of the next UN climate summit COP30 in Brazil in November.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletterto get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

The contributors gave their opinions about the quality and content of TV programmes in light of the recent increase in the licence fee.\nAs Bilbow says in his introduction, the idea was that \"nothing has been taken out, the conversation is exactly as it happened\".\nThis experiment inspired the conception of the Open Door series in which individuals or groups would make their own programmes, with the help of the newly-created BBC Community Programme Unit, to speak directly to audiences without editorial interference.\nThis programme wasoriginally broadcast on BBC Two, Friday 19 February, 1971.\nExplore more and followBBC Archive.\n1971: Late Night Line-Up.

    "text": "If somebody writes the TV miniseries version of this Wolves season, one of the episodes will begin in the home dressing room at Molineux just before 16:00 GMT on Saturday.\nThe second half againstArsenalis about to begin. The young actor playing Joao Gomes will look up at the Vitor Pereira character and say something like: \"Don't worry gaffer. I'm in control - I've got this.\"\nFade to a slow-motion shot of Gomes being tempted into just one more tackle, then burying his head in his hands, then to Pereira in the technical area, tearing at the air as if trying to burn off his frustration by ripping an invisible phone directory in half.\nPereira described the half-time scene wistfully afterwards, but took care to speak up for his young midfielder.\n\"Joao Gomes is a fantastic player - a team player,\" he said. \"Every time we learn lessons in life, football is the same. He wants to help the team every time, but it's football in the moment - it's difficult to control.\n\"I asked him, even during the second half: 'Joao, keep calm, don't take risks.' But in the end, it's football.\"\nThere was some criticism of Pereira afterwards, but this seemed a little unkind. Yes, just like in a cliched TV show, the elements that put the main character in jeopardy seemed in hindsight too obvious to ignore: the contentious red card for Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly setting the whole game on edge, the earlier caution for Gomes, his naturally aggressive style, the urgency to grab the chance to beat 10 men... So replace him before it happens.\nBut would Wolves' hope of seizing that chance not have been weakened by withdrawing Gomes, who is clearly now their leading midfielder in the system Pereira wants to use?\n\"We need as soon as possible another midfielder, with the skills and qualities to play with two midfielders,\" said Pereira. \"Tommy Doyle is a very good midfielder, but usually plays with three. [Jean-Ricner] Bellegarde can play as a midfielder - with three. To cover the pitch and play in the way I want to play with two is difficult. We need another solution.\"\nUnless a signing is made quickly, Pereira may have no choice but to find another way on Saturday, with Gomes suspended.\nThis is the drama of life near the bottom of the league. Every decision is more pressured, every choice is a dilemma and the margin for error slimmer by the week.\nListen to full commentary of Wolves vAston Villaat 17:30 GMT on Saturday on BBC Radio WM's FM frequencies\nTune intoThe West Midlands Football Phone-Infrom 18:00 on weeknights",

    "text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said the government is exploring the option of privately financing the Lower Thames Crossing project.\nIn herkeynote speech on growing the economy, she said the tunnel would be part of the \"infrastructure our country desperately needs\".\nThe crossing would become the largest road tunnel in the UK and would be built underneath the Thames linking Tilbury in Essex and Gravesend in Kent.\nCosted at about £8.3bn, it will be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in British history.\n\"We will work with the private sector to deliver the infrastructure that our country desperately needs,\" said Reeves.\n\"This includes the Lower Thames Crossing, which will improve connectivity at Dover, Felixstowe and Harwich – alleviating severe congestion as goods destined to export come from the north and the Midlands and across the country to markets overseas.\n\"To drive growth and deliver value for money for taxpayers we are exploring options to privately finance this important project.\"\nChief Secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, also told MPs his team was \"committed\" to bringing the project forward.\nThe 14-mile road (22.5km) would link the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and the M25 in Thurrock, and 2.6 miles of it (4.2km) would go under ground.\nNational Highways says the road will reduce traffic at the Dartford Crossing by 20%.\nWork on the project has been ongoing since 2009 and more than £800m in taxpayers' money has been spent on planning.\nNational Highways wants to put spades in the ground in 2026, and to open it by 2032.\nRichard Smith from the Road Haulage Association said in a statement: \"The project will provide much-needed reliability for businesses.\n\"The delays at Dartford decrease productivity and increase costs for businesses, particularly those reliant on freight\".\nAnn Scott, from the Federation of Small Businesses in Essex, said 57% of its members thought their companies would grow if the new crossing was constructed.\nSome councils, campaigners and politicians have opposed the project.\nJen Craft, the Labour MP for Thurrock, said she remained opposed to the current crossing proposals: \"I have concerns around the disruption this would cause to local residents and the impact on air quality in the area.\"\nA spokesperson from campaign group Transport Action Network said the crossing was the \"worst possible solution to solving congestion at Dartford\" or \"meeting net zero commitments\".\n\"Exploring options for privately financing [the crossing] does nothing to address its fundamental flaws; generating ever more traffic and harmful emissions, devastating the market for international rail freight and damaging the competitiveness of our seaports north of the Thames,\" they said.\nThurrock Council has also opposed the project, and its Labour group, which leads the authority, said:\"It would cause huge damage to our environment and ecology as well as doing little to add to the resilience of our local road network.\"\nThe government is expected to make a final decision in May, on whether the scheme can go ahead.\nFollow Essex news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Reverberations are being felt around the world after it emerged that US President Donald Trump was pausing American foreign aid. Among the countries in an uncertain position is Syria, where authorities face an uphill struggle to secure camps and prisons after conflict.\nFrom a distance, al-Hol camp looks like a tent city.\nIn 2019, after the defeat of Islamic State (IS) militants, about 40,000 IS family members were housed in this camp in the Kurdish-controlled region of north-eastern Syria.\nMost of the residents of the camp are women and children. It is so vast that it has its own bazaar and a clinic with a maternity unit.\nIraqi and Syrian Kurdish authorities fear it has become a breeding ground for IS. There are thought to be about 4,500 IS militants, including foreign fighters, held in prisons in this Kurdish-controlled region.\nUS President Donald Trump's decision to cut aid could make it harder for the Kurdish authorities to provide food, pay guards and ensure the security of both the camps and the prisons.\nFriday's news that the US Department of State had issued a halt to nearly all existing foreign assistance, and paused new aid, prompted a few turbulent days at al-Hol, before operations resumed on Tuesday.\nJihan Hana is the camp manager, a Kurdish woman in her 40s. Speaking to the BBC on Tuesday, she explained that her team relied heavily on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to provide for the camp's residents - and that some NGOs received up to 70% of their funding from the US.\n\"Today until 2pm, we didn't even have bread delivery scheduled,\" she said. \"An NGO that co-ordinates the return of Iraqis from the camp halted its operations because it couldn't pay the guards. The NGO sent its civilian employees home and, as a result, the return of over 500 Iraqis has been delayed.\"\nThe fear of reduced aid poses a significant security threat for al-Hol. The NGOs depend on foreign funding to pay guards and maintain order. Entry into the camp is only permitted under armed security escort because of the volatile conditions.\nA State Department statement did not comment directly on events at the camp but said the review of foreign aid spending was necessary.\n\"National security is and will remain a top priority. The review period is a measure put in place for us to align our ongoing work with the America First agenda.\"\nWe first visited the section of the camp designated for Iraqi and Syrian nationals. Men, women and children all reside here. Many of the children were born here.\nThe importance of the camp is highlighted by the fact that many of its inhabitants are afraid to leave to return home.\nMaria, a 19-year-old Iraqi girl dressed in black with only her eyes visible, said she was 12 when she arrived at the camp. \"My father is in prison and I don't know where he is held,\" she said. When asked if she wanted to return home, she shook her head and tears came to her eyes. \"I am afraid of revenge.\"\nWhen IS took over cities in Syria and Iraq, they killed many tribal and community leaders. Many IS family members have their own fears of imprisonment by their governments, or of retaliation from local communities.\nLast week, Kurdish authorities offered to allow all of the camp's 16,000 Syrian nationals to voluntarily return home. Some have already left.\nBut many of them, like Abu Ebrahim - a Syrian from Hama - said he feared facing retribution. \"I don't feel safe, I prefer to stay here for now,\" he said.\nSleeper cells for IS are reportedly active within the camp, and many inhabitants fear repercussions for speaking out. Others still believe in the IS ideology. There is always fear of detainees escaping - a fear that has not been assuaged by the possibility of an aid cut.\nThe foreign section houses families of IS members from more than 40 nationalities - including Europeans, Americans and families from former Soviet states. Camp manager Jihan Hana described this section as housing the most devoted supporters of IS ideology. Entry requires an armoured vehicle and heightened security.\nOur guide Diana, a Kurdish security officer, explained that this section was composed solely of women and children.\n\"They are highly organised,\" she said. \"They have their own secret police and secret courts, and violators of IS rules are punished. Boys over the age of 13 are separated from their families and taken to deradicalisation programmes.\"\nThe camp's policy of separating boys at the age of 13 has drawn criticism from human rights groups, but was defended by Jihan Hana, who cited security concerns. \"The boys can cause significant problems. There have been uprisings where sections of the camp were set on fire and anyone entering was attacked.\"\nDuring an interview with a woman from Tajikistan, children surrounded us.\nWhen I tried to interact with them by offering a high five or handshake, they spat, kicked and threw stones at us. Some raised the IS one-finger salute, shouting \"Allahu Akbar\", which means \"God is Great\".\nGen Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), told the BBC the conflict in northern Syria - where Turkish-backed Islamist militias have intensified attacks against the Kurds - has further strained resources.\n\"Turkey's aim is to attack Kobane. If the fighting continues, we will have to redeploy forces to the front lines. This would create a security vacuum, potentially enabling Isis sleeper cells to stage attacks on camps and prisons to free their family members and militants from detention.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of responses.\nThe president started his White House news conference as \"consoler-in-chief\" but then pivoted into unevidenced political blame, writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.\nThe president also suggested he still plans to impose new tariffs on China but did not give any details.\nAhmed al-Sharaa has been named \"transitional\" president after leading the overthrow of the Assad regime.\nTrump's two cabinet nominees were grilled on their ties to Capitol rioters and past comments.",

    "text": "Villagers whose rural home place has been earmarked for a major new train station have voiced concerns they \"don't want the village to turn into a city\".\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has backed building Tempsford station in Bedfordshire, which would offer connections to the East Coast Main Line and East West Rail, as part of a move to make \"Europe's Silicon Valley\" between Oxford and Cambridge.\nDuring a landmark speech on economic growth, Ms Reeves said on Wednesday the government would \"move quicker to deliver a main line station\".\nParish council chairman David Sutton said residents were worried, with an East West Rail report suggesting the village of about 600 inhabitants could grow to 44,000.\nEast West Rail said the new interchange station in Tempsford, between Sandy and St Neots in Cambridgeshire, was now due to be \"delivered up to five years earlier than planned\", but no specific date was mentioned.\nIt would serve customers on the East Coast Main Line travelling north to south, while the £5bn Oxford to Cambridge track underwent construction.\nReeves said while university cities Oxford and Cambridge were \"only 66 miles apart\", there was a lack of fast rail travel between the area's towns and cities and affordable homes.\nThe chancellor said investments in the Oxford to Cambridge corridor could add £78bn to the UK economy by 2035.\nSupport was pledged to fund the East West Rail link - joining Oxford to Cambridge via places including Milton Keynes and Bedford - and the new Tempsford station.\nReeves said: \"At Tempsford - the nexus of the East Coast Main Line, the A1 and East West Rail - we will move quicker to deliver a main line station, meaning journey times to London of under an hour and to Cambridge within 30 minutes when East West Rail is operational.\"\nLeader of Central Bedfordshire Council, Adam Zerny (Independent), said while the high speed rail connections would bring new opportunities, he had met government officials to say houses and corresponding infrastructure must be built in the right place.\n\"I have shared... we have major concerns about big housing schemes around Tempsford, given the proximity of a major flood plain,\" he said.\nMr Sutton, who is also a landlord and reopened The Wheatsheaf village pub three months ago, said people were \"not against all development, but don't want the village to turn into a city\".\n\"I actually think more people are coming round to development, but it is just about the scale of it.\n\"We don't want tens of thousands of homes and no infrastructure.\n\"It's a very small rural community - they've either farmed here for generations or they've moved specifically to a rural community, they don't want to live in a big city.\"\nHe added there were also concerns about noise from the trains, a lack of access to the station from the new A421 and the impact of housebuilding, given Tempsford's \"worse and worse\" annual winter flooding.\nFarmer Richard Infield, whose family has lived in the area since the 1600s, was one of those who echoed the worries about the village's flood issues.\n\"The more housing and railways we have coming in, it's going to create more problems for us to get rid of the water,\" he said.\n\"If you're going to put more hard surfaces down, you're going to have water come quicker.\n\"With all the building that has happened in Bedfordshire, we're getting to the point where we're saturated.\n\"It's making life a lot, lot harder for us to live in these areas.\"\nA consultation into the site and design of Tempsford station ended last week, after the preferred route was revealed in May 2023.\nThe station's exact location and final design will be disclosed at the statutory consultation, due to be held in the next year.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.\nThe 3.8% increase means an anytime return ticket between Glasgow and Edinburgh will rise by £1.20.\nThe centre in Orchard Park is designed to provide education, health and social support.\nA council proposes an additional £1 million to enhance Oxford’s historic Covered Market.\nAs Cardiff Parkway plans are approved, BBC Wales asks city centre commuters what they think.\nAlstom in Derby will open its factory to the public for the first time in more than 50 years.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The BBC has apologised to staff who felt they could not speak up with concerns about Russell Brand's behaviour because he was seen as \"too influential\" and they felt he \"would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\".\nThe apology came as the BBC published the findings of an internal review into Brand's time as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music between 2006 and 2008.\nThe investigation considered eight complaints, two of which were made while he worked for the corporation.\nOne of those, which related to him urinating into a cup and behaving aggressively during his Radio 2 show, was registered formally at the time, and the BBC has now admitted it was \"not dealt with effectively\".\nThe BBC launched the investigation after separate allegations in 2023 from several women who accused the 49-year-old actor and comedian of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse.\nBrand has denied all allegations and said his relationships were \"always consensual\".\nThursday's report found that \"only one formal complaint was made about Brand's inappropriate conduct in the workplace\" during his stint on air, and beyond that there was \"no evidence that his behaviour was raised with management formally at the time\".\nBut the BBC acknowledged that Brand was \"perceived to be too influential\" for staff to complain about.\nMany of those interviewed for the internal investigation \"believed, rightly or wrongly, that Russell Brand would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\", the report said. They also believed he \"had the support of the station management\".\nWhile one informal complaint was also made, the report said \"it is clear that there were other concerns but those involved felt unable or unwilling to raise these at the time as they felt the concerns would not be taken seriously and the systems for making complaints were not as clear as they are now\".\nCommenting on the report, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the complaints were \"horrendous\".\n\"As is the fact that staff felt unable to raise concerns because they did not think that they would be believed or taken seriously,\" she said.\nShe added that the BBC must \"take action to reassure its staff and the wider public that it takes these issues seriously\".\n\"For too long, there has been a culture of silence in the media industry where inappropriate behaviour like Brand's has been tolerated or downplayed. Power imbalances and a perception that certain stars cannot be challenged are sadly not unique to this case.\"\nThe review also found that Brand had consensual sex with a competition winner from his 6 Music show on BBC premises.\nSpeaking to the review team, that person said that while what happened was consensual, they now felt \"Brand had abused his position and taken advantage of them\".\nThe report added that there were \"management failings\" and \"there should have been better systems in place to ensure that Brand's unacceptable behaviour was promptly picked up and addressed\".\nChannel 4, where Brand also worked as a presenter, released its own internal review findings in March 2024.Its boss apologised to a former employeeafter the probe found it had not investigated a \"serious\" complaint made against the star in 2009.\nBrand has been interviewed three times by police since September 2023.\nIn November 2024,the Metropolitan Police sent the Crown Prosecution Servicea file of evidence, but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring charges.\nA BBC employee made a formal complaint to a manager in 2007 after Brand urinated into a cup in the Radio 2 studio, and then threw objects in anger when one of the production team made a mistake during a second show.\nThe report said it was likely that this was then raised verbally with the Radio 2 controller at the time, Lesley Douglas, although she does \"not recall these concerns ever being raised with her\".\nDouglas denied that Brand ever sought to exercise any influence over her, and said her relationship with him was similar to that she had with other presenters on the station.\nThe BBC made light of the 2007 incident in a press response at the time, the report said, when a spokesperson told the Independent that Brand had urinated in a cup \"and someone has shown him where the toilet is\".\n\"Regrettably this incident was not taken seriously at this time,\" the report said.\nAnother staff member said they had raised concerns informally about Brand's conduct in 2006 and 2007, the report said.\nSomeone else alleged that Brand \"tucked his fingers down their trousers and underwear and pulled them towards him\" in a corridor while on set of a BBC radio production, but did not complain at the time.\nStaff members who were \"most closely\" involved in his shows described his behaviour in general as \"promiscuous or out-of-control\", but said they did not \"witness anything non-consensual or potentially illegal\".\nAnother complaint was made to the BBC about an incident in Los Angeles in 2008.\nBrand is alleged to have followed \"Olivia\" into a bathroom and shown his penis to her moments before he began pre-recording his radio show.\nThe woman, who was not a BBC employee but worked in the same building, did not complain at the time, thinking \"she would not be believed\".\nThe report found no evidence of anyone in BBC management being aware of Olivia's experience at the time.\nIn 2019, a BBC News staff member raised the incident with their line manager after Olivia confirmed she wanted to take the matter further.\n\"It is likely those involved in escalating the complaint in 2019 felt that there was nothing that could be done as it was over ten years later,\" the report said.\nIt concluded that the complaint process was \"inadequate\", as was the handling of the 2019 complaint, and the BBC has apologised to Olivia.\nAnother of the complaints in the report was made by a woman named Alice, who said a car provided by the BBC for Brand collected her and took her to his house when he was in his 30s and she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl.\nThe report concluded that it was not able to verify these claims but it was \"unlikely that the cars described by Alice were chauffeur-driven BBC cars or BBC management cars\".\nThe report, and Alice, agree that if Brand did \"persuade a taxi or mini-cab pre-booked on his behalf by the BBC to make these journeys, it's likely to have been done without the knowledge of the BBC staff who booked his cars for him in advance\".\nThe review cost £662,062 and was conducted by the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston.\nHe added: \"The processes for raising any concerns were also not as developed as they are now.\n\"In the intervening years the BBC has introduced other mechanisms and routes for staff to raise concerns.\"\nThe actress will leave the soap in February, more than three decades after her first appearance.\nPatrick Vallance says plans for 'Europe's Silicon Valley' could be a big boost for the areas.\nThe journalist and author is stepping down from the programme but will continue to work with the BBC.\nCost-saving measures include closing posts in the UK and internationally and roles in BBC Monitoring.\nA senior producer calls for more Scottish-based production workers to be hired for the hit show filmed in the Highlands.",

    "text": "A mother and daughter have been cleared of killing a shop security guard after being accused of attacking him with a walking frame.\nBill Ireland, 62, collapsed and died at Rejects store in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in January 2023 after trying to stop them leaving with stolen goods.\nTeresa Gordon, 59, and Nicola Gordon, 37 - who said she stole to fund a drug habit -  denied assaulting and killing Mr Ireland.\nA jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found the charges not proven. A theft charge was withdrawn by prosecutors.\nThe pair had been accused of behaving in an aggressive manner, attempting to wrestle a rucksack and jacket from Mr Ireland, and striking him on the legs with Teresa Gordon's walking frame.\nHe sustained a cardiac arrhythmia, fell to the ground and died.\nThe court heard that Mr Ireland took medication for high blood pressure, but following a postmortem was found to have significant coronary artery disease.\nNicola Gordon, from Kirkcaldy, told the court she shoplifted to fund an addiction to crack cocaine and heroin.\nShe said she was no longer using drugs but said her addiction had cost her \"hundreds of pounds\" a day.\nShe said she regularly stole from shops, and passed the stolen goods to drug dealers in exchange for drugs.\nShe admitted that on the day of Mr Ireland's death she stole four tins of paint before he intervened.\nShe said Mr Ireland got a hold of her by the \"scruff\" of her jacket and pinned her against a wall.\nMs Gordon said: \"I didn't know who the man was. He still had not disclosed to me he was a security guard by this point.\n\"I have been caught shoplifting before and I have never experienced anything like that.\"\nShe said her mother pushed her wheeled walking frame towards the security officer and shouted at him to get his hands off.\nTeresa Gordon accepted that it appeared in footage from the store that she was pushing her walking frame towards Mr Ireland.\nA store employee told the court that after Mr Ireland fell she said: \"I never touched him, I never touched him,\" and shouted that she hoped he died.\nThe mother said she was \"disgusted\" by her daughter's behaviour when she realised she was shoplifting from the store.\nShe said: \"My daughter never assaulted Mr Ireland. That's not true.\"\nConsultant cardiologist Dr Stuart Hutcheon said it was almost certain that the events of that day had exacerbated Mr Ireland's heart conditions.\nDr Hutcheon said: \"When the events occurred, Mr Ireland underwent sudden and significant physical and emotional stress.\n\"The reduced blood supply to the heart in turn caused Mr Ireland to suffer a fatal cardiac arrhythmia.\"\nTrial judge, Lady Ross, said: \"This has been a difficult case in many respects.\n\"There are no easy or pleasant cases in the High Court. All cases that come before the High Court are difficult and this is no exception.\"\nShe said the women were free to go.",

    "text": "This video can not be played\nChampions League highlights: Aston Villa 4-2 Celtic\nCeltic's enthralling defeat at Aston Villa was a near-perfect illustration of the club's gripping, and ultimately successful, Champions League campaign.\nA campaign which now rolls on to a tantalising two-legged play-off against either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in less than two weeks.\nIn Birmingham, there were shades of the Borussia Dortmund horror show as Villa scored twice in the opening five minutes, while missing a host of other chances.\nCeltic players looked stunned and cowed in a raucous stadium against an elite side.\nBut as those memories of the Westfalenstadion on matchday two - banished by recent improvements at Europe's top table - came rushing back, Celtic dug deep.\nThere was some of the fight and character shown in digging out a point at Atalanta and coming from behind to draw with Club Brugge as they steadied.\nThen some of the swashbuckling stuff seen against RB Leipzig and Slovan Bratislava as Adam Idah ended his goal drought with a double to level.\nThat got Celtic right back in the contest, which gripped until Morgan Rogers completed his hat-trick to make it 4-2 in stoppage time, as the pressure from Villa proved too much in the second half.\nEven in disappointment the Celtic players and fans, both drained from another epic night, left Villa Park knowing the story is not over.\nThey get to do it all again in the play-off round against a European giant, with the draw made on Friday.\nThat was the aim, but now they're there, Brendan Rodgers and his players will want to make the most of it.\nCeltic can 'make it difficult' for Bayern or Real\nVilla v Celtic - reaction & as it happened\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nWhile Celtic's fightback and competitiveness was admirable, the defeat was a reminder of the unforgiveable nature of playing the best in the Champions League.\nVilla scored four, missed a penalty, hit a post, had one cleared off the line, racking up a hefty expected goals rating of 3.79.\nCeltic played on the edge of chaos as they pressed and tried to move the ball quickly. At times it worked, but there were also a lot of mistakes.\nCeltic conceded a lot of chances against Aston Villa\nThey were caught in possession trying to play out from the back for Villa's second.\nAnd Liam Scales was punished ruthlessly for pushing too high up the pitch for the third as Villa easily broke through on the counter.\nAuston Trusty erratically slid in to give away a penalty, while a poor header from the American in the first half lead to Jacob Ramsey hitting a post.\nYoung defender Dane Murray - only recently returned from Queen's Park - was robbed in his own box for the fourth in stoppage time.\nThere were plenty more moments when Celtic got themselves into trouble.\nWithout their best centre-back Cameron Carter-Vickers it was always going to be a tough task defensively, while Daizen Maeda's defensive output was missed as Villa got joy down the flanks in the first half.\nMaeda will miss the first leg of the next round due to suspension, and with Kyogo Furuhashi away to Rennes, and left-back Alex Valle joining him out the door, the last few days of the transfer window are big for the club.\nWith Real or Bayern coming to town, they need to make sure they are as strong as possible from back to front.\nDortmund aside, Celtic have been competitive and adaptable throughout this campaign, and reaching the play-off round is just rewards for that.\nThis video can not be played\nIdah scores double to draw Celtic level\nIn the week Celtic lost talismanic striker Kyogo, Idah provided a timely reminder of his capabilities to some of the more angst-ridden among the club's fans.\nThat could be the biggest positive to come from this defeat.\nThe Irishman's two goals - the first Villa had conceded on their own patch in the Champions League - not only hauled his team back level from a bleak position, but demonstrated his finishing abilities to many who had forgotten he had them.\nThe final goal in a 5-0 home win against Ross County at the end of November was the last time the Irishman found the net before Wednesday.\n'BVP' - before Villa Park - might become the reference point in Idah's Celtic career, if he can kick on from this and fill Kyogo's substantial shoes.\nThe hope for Rodgers is Idah's instinctive finishes, particularly for the first goal where he managed to react brilliantly to get his leg in a difficult position to lash home, will spark something.\nThere were also glimpses of his running power in behind, particularly one moment in the second half when he sprinted in behind and got a strike away.\nRodgers said afterwards it will be \"big for his confidence\", and this campaign has been a boost for Celtic's overall esteem on the grandest stage in club football.\nTheir progress was epitomised by their first-half fightback in Birmingham.\nThey have nothing to lose from here on, but the next challenge is to make sure the pride they have worked so hard to restore remains intact against one of the giants of European football.\nThis video can not be played\nRodgers proud of Celtic performance",

It says that 243 migrants have lost their lives attempting to cross since 2018.\nIts figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or as a result of medical issues.\nThe Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, withmore people crammed into less seaworthy boats.\nThe latest figures - for the year to September 2024 - show that almost 5,000 Afghans crossed the Channel.\nIranians were the second largest group, followed by people from Syria, Vietnam and Eritrea.\nWhere recorded, more than 80% were male.

    "text": "We asked how you were feeling following the news that Miguel Almiron has returned to Atlanta United after six years at Newcastle and asked for your standout moments from the Paraguayan.\nHere are some of your comments:\nPeter:Gracias por todos, Miggy! One of the most hard-working, honest players. I'll remember his smile most of all, and the celebration after he opened the scoring on that glorious night against Paris St-Germain.\nTim:A true club player who gave 110% in every game he played in. Scored our first goal in Europe in two decades and some other crackers as well in his time. He's had a good run and I for one wish him well for the future. A lovely lad as well. Good luck, Miggy!\nJoff:Almiron epitomised everything that was exciting about the Toon team as it emerged from the doldrums of the Mike Ashley era. His effort and passion were on show every time he pulled the shirt on. We owe him. He will remain in all Toon hearts for a long time, in the same way as the likes of Nobby Solano and Cheick Tiote.\nKen:Only positive memories of Miggy. His work ethic was probably better than anyone, he was happy and always a smile and he scored some brilliant goals in our best season for years. The only downside was how some fans disrespected him on social media. It makes you ashamed of the fans at times. His love of Newcastle will ensure he will be remembered fondly and always be welcome in Newcastle.\nSteve:Miggy let no one down, I just wished the club could have given him a final swansong this Saturday. He would have got the send-off with best wishes like no other. Will miss his smile.\nChris:Miggy was a real dynamo for us when we needed fighting spirit. He helped keep us up and always played his heart out. He loved Newcastle and we loved him back. I know we have to sell to move forward and I can only hope he is happy back in Atlanta.",

    "text": "This video can not be played\nAustralia pile the pressure on England\nWomen's Ashes: One-off Test, Melbourne (day one of four)\nEngland 170 (71.4 overs):Sciver-Brunt 51; King 4-45\nAustralia 56-1 (22 overs):Sutherland 24*; Bell 1-21\nAustralia trail by 114 runs\nScorecard\nEngland are already on the back foot in their attempt to avoid a 16-0 clean sweep in the Women's Ashes, having been bowled out for 170 on day one of the one-off Test.\nLeg-spinner Alana King took 4-45 as England crumbled inside 72 overs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nAll-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt provided the only resistance for England with a gritty 51 from 129 balls amid an array of wasteful dismissals.\nEngland then bowled 22 overs at the end of the day, in favourable conditions with the pink ball under floodlights, but Phoebe Litchfield and Annabel Sutherland batted sensibly to reach 56-1 at the close of play, trailing by 114 runs.\nEarlier, England had been put in to bat and it took just four balls for their all-too-familiar batting woes to resurface with Maia Bouchier caught behind in Kim Garth's opening over.\nGarth also removed captain Heather Knight for 25, Tammy Beaumont was trapped lbw by Darcie Brown for eight before a stand of 50 between Sciver-Brunt and Sophia Dunkley led a rebuilding effort from 47-3.\nBut Australia expertly exposed England's spin weaknesses once more as they lost four wickets to King and Ash Gardner combined in the afternoon session to dent any hopes of posting a competitive total.\nAustralia will be confident of accelerating on day two with their formidable batting depth, having only lost debutant Georgia Voll to Lauren Bell for 12.\nAfter winning all six preceding white-ball matches, Australia are now eyeing all 16 points from the series, which has never been achieved in the multi-format Ashes.\n'Warne-esque' Alana shines at the King's HQ\nThis video can not be played\nKing's spin dismantles England\nIt was another formidable effort from Australia's all-round bowling attack, kickstarted by the relentless accuracy of their seamers and backed up by the theatre created by King's spin.\nBouchier's horrid run at the top of the order continued as she fell for two, meaning she has scored 41 runs in six innings across the series, prodding at a good-length delivery from Garth's fourth ball as the hosts took immediate control.\nAt the other end, Brown complemented her opening partner beautifully with a fiery spell of fast bowling that saw Beaumont plumb in front.\nKnight thwarted them for 50 balls before falling in the same manner and while Sciver-Brunt looked solid, England's middle order once again came completely unstuck as soon as the spinners came to the fore.\nBowling after tea, King had Dunkley caught and bowled for 21 and Danni Wyatt-Hodge was caught by a diving Litchfield in front of the bat for 22 as both players continued the frustrating trend of making starts but failing to capitalise.\nAmy Jones missed a straight one from Gardner for three and in the following over, Sophie Ecclestone's dismissal - swiping the ball straight to Garth at cover after seven balls - somewhat summarised England's tour.\nRyana Macdonald-Gay admirably held firm for 15 from 66 balls but could do little else to prevent yet another thoroughly dominant Australian performance.\nThis video can not be played\nEcclestone chips it straight to Garth\nWith conditions in their favour in the evening session, England's seamers performed admirably considering the poor batting effort that had just unfolded.\nBell continued her fine series as she plugged away at a full length to the openers, eventually getting her reward as Voll was tempted into driving and edged behind to Jones.\nFellow seamers Filer and Sciver-Brunt were equally economical and gave little away but credit must be given to Australia's young batters who smartly withstood the threat.\nSutherland was moved up the order to three after an injury to Ellyse Perry and immediately looked at home, making 24 from 51 balls, while left-hander Litchfield battled to 20 by playing the swinging ball late.\nEngland opted for the extra pace of Macdonald-Gay over Charlie Dean's off-spin but that could come into question considering the turn that King extracted in the first innings.\nEcclestone should be prepared for another of her long spells on day two, as Australia will look to cash in with a batting line-up that boasts the formidable Tahlia McGrath all the way down at number eight.\nThis video can not be played\nBell removes Voll as England take early wicket\nEngland seamer Lauren Bell:\"We dug pretty deep to get a total and had a lot of energy. As a seam bowler, it's a nice surface to bowl on. It's got a lot of lateral movement so we'll just have to play with that.\n\"Test match cricket is special, it feels quite separate from the rest of the series. You're playing a Test match at MCG, it's exciting, everyone gets excited about it. Our focus was on this, we parked the rest of the series.\"\nAustralia bowler player Darcie Brown:\"It was a really positive day for us. It's always nice to bowl them out on the first day and have a bat.\"\nEngland batter Danni Wyatt-Hodge, speaking to TNT Sports:\"It was really tough.

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "US President Donald Trump has said he will follow through with his threat to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with 25% border taxes, known as tariffs, on 1 February.\nBut he added that a decision about whether this would include oil from those countries had not yet been made.\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said the move was aimed to address the large amounts of undocumented migrants and the fentanyl that come across US borders as well as trade deficits with its neighbours.\nThe president also suggested that he was still planning to impose new tariffs on China,which he said earlier this month would be 10%, but did not give any details.\n\"With China, I'm also thinking about something because they're sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they're causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,\" Trump said.\n\"So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we're in the process of doing that.\"\nDuring the election campaign, Trump threatened to hit Chinese-made products with tariffs of up to 60%, but held off on any immediate action on his first day back in the White House, instead ordering his administration to study the issue.\nUS goods imports from China have flattened since 2018, a statistic that economists have attributed in part to a series of escalating tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term.\nEarlier this month, a top Chinese official warned against protectionism as Trump's return to the presidency renews the threat of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies - but did not mention the US by name.\nAddressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Ding Xuexiang, Vice Premier of China, said his country was looking for a \"win-win\" solution to trade tensions and wanted to expand its imports.\nCanada and Mexico have said that they would respond to US tariffs with measures of their own, while also seeking to assure Washington that they were taking action to address concerns about their US borders.\nIf US imports of oil from Canada and Mexico are hit with levies it risks undermining Trump's promise to bring down the cost of living.\nTariffs are an import tax on goods that are produced abroad.\nIn theory, taxing items coming into a country means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive.\nThe intention is that they buy cheaper local products instead - boosting a country's economy.\nBut the cost of tariffs on imported energy could be passed on to businesses and consumers, which may increase the prices of everything from petrol to groceries.\nAround 40% of the crude that runs through US oil refineries is imported, and the vast majority of it comes from Canada.\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of responses.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe president started his White House news conference as \"consoler-in-chief\" but then pivoted into unevidenced political blame, writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.",

    "text": "This video can not be played\nI do like getting my hands dirty - Brooklyn Beckham on Formula E racing\nFormula E is pitting 11 influencers against each other in 200mph cars that have a quicker acceleration rate than F1 in an effort to raise the sport's profile.\nThe likes of former Manchester City striker turned content creator Sergio Aguero, and Brooklyn Beckham will be racing in the electric-powered vehicles, which can go from 0-60mph in 1.82 seconds - 30% faster than a current F1 car.\nAguero has amassed 30m followers on social media platform Instagram, while Beckham has 16m.\n\"Using their reach, their profiles and their fan base to help elevate ours feels like a really good combination,\" says Formula E chief executive Jeff Dodds.\nEach influencer will be paired with a professional FE team and driver, and then undergo six weeks of intensive training before getting behind the wheel of this season's cars and racing at a circuit in Miami on 5-6 March.\nIt is the latest example of a sport trying to harness the popularity of celebrities to generate content and reach younger audiences.\nBut will it work? And does it risk devaluing the real action on track?\n\"I'm really excited,\" says Beckham. \"Like my dad, I've always been obsessed with driving.\"\nBrooklyn Beckham is getting married!\nBrooklyn Beckham's book branded 'brilliant' and 'terrible'\nBrooklyn is the eldest son of former England football captain David and ex-Spice Girl Victoria Beckham.\nHe has earned millions of pounds from brand endorsement deals and is being paid an undisclosed amount for this partnership which will see him post footage of the training to his social media followers.\n\"It's getting more people to experience Formula E,\" Beckham tells BBC Sport from his home in Los Angeles.\nHe drove a safety car at the Mexico E-Prix in 2020 and has attended several races, although admits he has not yet told his wife Nicola Peltz of his plan.\n\"We'll see what she says,\" he laughs.\n\"I was blown away, and the more people who do [see it], the more people will understand.\"\nAdding that he finds it \"unbelievable how quiet and how fast\" FE cars are, Beckham claims that while \"Formula One has been going on for a lot longer, the world is changing, so I think [FE] definitely has a chance to come close to it.\n\"I love this chance to meet the Formula E team and learn more about how the cars work.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWhy Formula E are working with influencers\nWhat about concerns that such collaborations risk diminishing the skill and effort required to reach this level of the sport?\nBeckham is known for his previous attempts to break into modelling, photography and cookery. He also tried to follow in his father's footsteps, but was released by Arsenal's academy aged 15.\n\"When this comes out, people are going to think that I'm going to try and become an F1 driver,\" he says.\n\"They think I'm going to change careers again. But people will understand and realise how mentally tough this sport is.\n\"These guys in these cars are just so talented. I'm just really excited to meet them and be a part of this.\"\nA decade on from its debut, Dodds defends using such personalities.\n\"They are masterful at creating compelling video content,\" he says.\n\"Collectively they have around 300m followers on social media, so bringing this product to that audience has to be a good thing for the sport.\n\"It's not a gimmick because it's the real car on a Grade 1 racing track.\"\nThe influencers will be behind the wheels of the fastest accelerating single-seater race car in the world.\n\"They'll be on the track individually, which is a much safer environment,\" says Dodds who wants to introduce this as a standalone promotional event in the race calendar.\n\"But it also gives them the opportunity to push the boundaries as far as they're comfortable. This will be a case of how brave are they? How far are they prepared to push the car?\"\nThe amateur drivers will be put through their paces in a driving simulator before being guided by the professionals in dedicated physical and driver training sessions.\n\"The main ambition is to show the difference between someone learning to drive these cars and the gap between them and elite drivers,\" adds Dodds.\n\"If anything, it's going to showcase just how highly-skilled these drivers are.\"\nBeckham says he is looking forward to getting behind the wheel again in March\nAs well as having to contend with the disruption of Covid, Formula E has had various broadcast partners in the UK, hampering efforts to grow its audience here.\nWhile its finances are improving, an annual loss of $45m (£36m) was posted last year.\nBut Dodds is upbeat, predicting that by 2030, Formula E can overtake MotoGP in terms of popularity in motorsport, and be second only to Formula 1.\n\"We have around 400m fans around the world - about half the size of F1 in just 10 years,\" he says.\n\"So I'd argue that's a really successful first period, and we have a broadcast reach of about half a billion around the world that's growing between 20 and 30% every year.\n\"I don't look at F1 and say 'we have to beat them', because it's a very different product and audience.\"\nThis will not be the first time sport has latched on to the power of celebrity as a marketing stunt, of course.\nLast year Ivan Buhajeruk, known as Spreen, who has millions of YouTube followers, was controversially allowed to play for Deportivo Riestra - one of Argentina's top football teams - in a league match.\nHe was substituted after just one minute having not touched the ball, but the publicity antic sparked a major backlash.\nMeanwhile, YouTubers taking part in boxing started out as a novelty in 2018.\nTo the dismay of traditionalists, so-called 'crossover fights' have since become a feature of the sport, raising concerns over integrity and safety but also generating huge interest from younger fans.\n\"I'm a massive boxing fan and I choose not to watch a lot of those bouts,\" says Dodds.\n\"Some would argue that Jake Paul v Mike Tyson is not amazing for the sport, although a lot of people watched it. We're not doing that.\n\"I'm not pitting [current champion] Pascal Wehrlein against Brooklyn Beckham. I'm simply using the sport as a vehicle to raise the profile of the championship in an environment that doesn't diminish the sport.\n\"In order for sports to grow and be successful they also need to be entertainment platforms.\"\nTeam criticised for picking YouTube star as striker\n'Blame Mike' - absurdity and appeal of Tyson v Paul",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "President Donald Trump's pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, was questioned by senators at his first confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\nThe post of health secretary is a key federal government position that oversees public health issues, including medical research, food safety and public welfare programmes.\nKennedy, who had been a vocal vaccine sceptic, was asked to explain his past comments on the Covid-19 vaccine and other immunisations. He also was asked about his views on abortion, and his opinions on the US food industry.\nHis hearing was interrupted by shouting protesters, but he also received loud applause when he promised he would make America healthy again, a slogan used by the new administration.\nHere are five takeaways from Kennedy's first hearing.\nThroughout the hearing, senators brought up Kennedy's past comments about vaccination.\nA group he ran for eight years, Children's Health Defense, repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccinations, and continues to push the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism.\nKennedy insisted during the hearing that he was not anti-vaccine, and that he merely supports more stringent studies and safety tests for injections.\nHe said he supports the current childhood vaccination schedule and insisted he was not a conspiracy theorist.\n\"That's a pejorative that's applied to me to keep me from asking difficult questions about powerful interests,\" he told senators.\nHowever, they zeroed in on his past comments, such as a quote taken from a 2023 podcast when he said: \"I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they're causing. There's no vaccine that is safe and effective.\"\nHe defended himself at the hearing, saying his words were taken out of context and that he was going to go on to say \"for all people\". But, Kennedy said, he was interrupted by the host, Lex Fridman, who said: \"Those are big words\".\nIn the podcast interview, Kennedy went on to outline what he called safety problems with several common vaccines, including the polio vaccine, and later called vaccines \"inherently unsafe\", apparently quoting former President Ronald Reagan.\nA key point during Kennedy's opening remarks and throughout the hearing was his criticism of processed foods in the US, which he said help drive the country's obesity epidemic.\nHe promised to scrutinise chemical additives in food, and said he would work to remove the financial conflicts of interest in US agencies and the food industry.\n\"We will reverse the chronic disease epidemic and put the nation back on the road to health,\" he told the committee.\nAsked why he was a big advocate of nutrition-based disease prevention, Kennedy said that this generation has seen an \"explosion\" of autoimmune and allergic diseases, as well as type 2 diabetes.\nHe later clarified that he does not want to take away access to processed food for Americans.\n\"If you like a McDonald's cheeseburger or a Diet Coke - which my boss loves - you should be able to get them,\" he said, referencing Trump's well-known affinity for the American fast-food chain.\nKennedy, who previously stated that he was in favour of abortion rights, was asked about his stance on the issue by both Republican and Democratic senators.\nRepublican Senator James Lankford asked Kennedy whether he plans to bring back conscience protections for doctors who do not want to perform the procedure because of religious or moral beliefs.\nKenney responded by saying that forcing medical providers who believe abortion is murder to carry out the procedure \"doesn't make any sense\".\nMichael Bennet, a Democratic senator, then asked Kennedy about his past comments, in which he expressed support for abortion rights and said that governments should not be involved in a woman's right to choose.\nKennedy started his response by saying: \"I believe every abortion is a tragedy.\"\nHe later said he agreed with Trump that access to abortion should be controlled by individual states. Kennedy vowed to put his more liberal views aside, saying, \"I serve at the pleasure of the president. I'm going to implement his policies.\"\nThis stance drew scrutiny from Democrats, including senator Maggie Hassan, who accused Kennedy of \"selling out\" his pro-choice values in order to secure President Trump's nomination.\nKennedy was asked by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a long-time advocate of universal healthcare, whether he believes the US should \"guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.\"\nHe responded by saying he cannot answer the question so simply.\nKennedy posed a hypothetical situation of a 20-year cigarette smoker with lung cancer, then pondered whether that individual should have the same healthcare access as someone who does not smoke.\nThe smoker, Kennedy said, would be \"taking from the pool\", referencing general health care costs.\nSanders then criticised the pharmaceutical industry, saying that in the US patients pay more than people in European countries for the same drugs. He asked Kennedy if he was willing to \"end that absurdity.\"\nKennedy responded: \"We should end that disparity\".\nLater, Sanders asked whether he supports baby clothes bearing anti-vaccine slogans. Some are sold by Children's Health Defense, the organisation that Kennedy founded.\n\"Are you supportive of these onesies?\" Sanders asked Kennedy, showing images of them to the rest of the committee.\nKennedy responded that he has no oversight of the organisation and resigned from his position there.\nAs is typical, the nature and tone of the questions often differed depending on which side of the political aisle they were coming from.\nDemocratic senators largely grilled him on his past anti-vaccine comments, his promotion of misinformation on health issues, and his knowledge of the US healthcare system, including Medicare and Medicaid.\nSome Republicans, however, focused their questions on Kennedy's advocacy for eradicating chronic disease in children and his criticism of the US food industry.\nOne Republican senator in particular, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said that Kennedy was the \"answer to his prayers,\" and that he was \"awesome\".\nJohnson himself has been criticised over anti-vaccine misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAs proceedings ended, Republican Senator and Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo gave Kennedy his stamp of approval.\n\"I think you have come through well, and deserve to be confirmed,\" he told Kennedy.\nDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden, on the other hand, accused Kennedy of delivering a \"word salad\" and ducking issues raised about his past anti-vaccine remarks.\n\"I find your presentation to be both untrustworthy and unprepared,\" Wyden said.\nWednesday's hearing was before the Senate's finance committee. Kennedy faces a second confirmation hearing on Thursday before the health, education, labour and pensions committee, where he will face more questions from senators.\nThe committees will then vote on his nomination before it can pass to the whole Senate for consideration.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter.

    "text": "A senior judge has rejected an attempt to overturn an inquest verdict of unlawful killing on a teenager who died while on a Scouts trip.\nBen Leonard, 16, died when he fell 200ft (60m) at Great Orme in Llandudno, North Wales while on a trip with the Reddish Explorer Scouts from Stockport, Greater Manchester, on 26 August 2018.\nThe trip's leader and his assistant, who were foundresponsible for unlawful killingat a jury inquest, have lost their High Court challenge against the verdict.\nBen's mother, Jackie Leonard said his family \"are just relieved it is now over and the judicial review failed\".\nBen and two friends took a different path from other Scouts, unsupervised by any leaders, who had \"lost\" the trio on the Orme.\nHe ended up on a 50cm (19 inch) ledge, which was an animal track, when he lost his footing, slipped and fell to his death.\nLast year a jury found Ben was unlawfully killed by the most senior Scout leader on the trip, and his assistant, and this was contributed to by neglect by The Scout Association, after a two-month inquest at Manchester Civil Courts of Justice.\nDuring the inquest, the Scout leader on the trip, Sean Glaister, declined to answer a series of questions from Bernard Richmond KC, representing Ben's family.\nMary Carr was named as the assistant Scout leader on the trip.\nDavid Pojur, assistant coroner for North Wales east and central, referred The Scout Association and an employee, who cannot be named by court order,to North Wales Police to investigatefor conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\nBut after the inquest, Mr Glaister and Ms Carr applied for a judicial review of the inquest findings of unlawful killing, heard at the High Court in Manchester in December.\nMr Justice Fordham ruled earlier that the coroner Mr Pojur had directed the jury fairly and correctly and rejected the appeal to review the inquest findings.\nBen's mother, Jackie Leonard said: \"We need to try to move forward now but with Ben in our hearts always.\"\nAt the beginning of the inquest last year, the third after two previous inquests were halted, The Scout Association for the first time publicly apologised and accepted responsibility for Ben's death.\nThe inquest also heard Ben's family were lied to as The Scout Association was worried about \"reputational damage\", and Ben's family were told, \"people who try and take on the Scouts are never successful\" and that \"no-one can touch the Scouts\".\nAbout 500,000 young people and 145,000 adult volunteers take part in Scouting projects and activities each week, according to the association's own figures.\nListen to the best ofBBC Radio Manchester on Soundsand follow BBC Manchester onFacebook,X, andInstagramand watch BBC North West Tonight onBBC iPlayer.\nThe immersive art installation is part of City of Culture events programme and aimed at families.\nSamuel Erlandson had indecent images of a child and extreme pornography involving a dog on his phone.\nA bronze Queen Victoria bust has gone missing from its plinth and is believed to have been stolen.\nSeveral high-value items were smashed or stolen from the Askern scout hut in Doncaster in September.\nMore than 100,000 children are currently on waiting lists to join, The Scout Association says.",

    "text": "Volunteer rescuers have freed a humpback whale entangled in ropes at a Skye salmon farm.\nThe animal was spotted in difficulty at Organic Sea Harvest's Invertote site near Staffin in the north of the islandon Thursday morning.\nBritish Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said the ropes was wrapped around the whale's head and left fin. The ropes are believed to have snagged on a chain anchored to the seabed.\nThe charity said the whale, which is about 8m (26ft) long, was exhausted and they were continuing to monitor it.\nOrganic Sea Harvest said during the rescue it was noted the whale had previously been entangled and was carrying old ropes of a type not used on the fish farm.\nA spokesperson said: \"It was this existing entangled rope which caught onto the farm moorings as it swam by.\n\"Thankfully the BDMLR team were not only able to free the whale from the salmon farm, but they were also able to free it of the other ropes it had been carrying.\"\nThe Scottish Entanglement Alliance (SEA) said it was believed it was a young whale.\nMartin Boon, of BDMLR, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethe rope was wrapped multiple times around the humpback's head and left fin.\nHe said the charity followed a technique that was developed in the US, and used for the first time in Europe in 2011, to free entangled whales.\nSpecial knives attached to poles are used to cut the rope in a set sequence.\nThe last cut finally frees the animal and avoids the risk of it still having some of the rope attached to it.\nMr Boon said Organic Sea Harvest provided small inflatable boats to allow a BDMLR team to get close to the humpback.\nHe said the rescue was \"potentially risky\".\n\"Obviously it is humpback - they are big and powerful,\" he said.\n\"If it thrashes about and it catches anybody in the team, that's not going to end well.\"\nMr Boon said most people working in the fishing industry were keen to help out when whales were in difficulty.\nSEA co-ordinator Ellie MacLennan said it was rare in Scotland for whales to become entangled at fish farms.\nShe said the size of the humpback suggested it had recently weaned from its mother.\nMs MacLennan told BBC Scotland News: \"There have been sightings reported in recent weeks of a mother and calf pair and of adult and juvenile animals.\n\"There was no mother hanging around yesterday, so it's likely to be independent of its mother.\"\nBDMLR, which was set up 40 years ago, successfully rescued a humpback caught in creel ropes in Loch Fyne in Argyll on 4 November.\nBut other whales have not been so lucky.\nIn May 2023, a humpback whale that washed up in a Highland loch possibly died after becoming caught up in creel fishing lines, say experts.\nThe animal's carcass was found on sand banks in Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve, near Golspie.\nScottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (Smass) identified it as a juvenile female humpback whale.\nOther humpbacks have been found dead inEast LothianandCaithnessfollowing entanglements.\nThese entanglements can involve creel fishing gear orghost gear- rope and nets that have been lost or abandoned by fishing boats.\nA sperm whale that died after stranding on the Isle of Harris in November 2019 had a 100kg \"litter ball\" in its stomach.\nFishing nets, rope, packing straps, bags and plastic cups were among the items discovered in a compacted mass during an investigation by Smass.",

    "title": "India's tiger population doubles in a decade offering key lessons",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "India now hosts the world's largest tiger population, despite having the highest human density and just 18% of global tiger habitat, according to a new study.\nIn just over a decade, India has doubled its tiger population to more than 3,600, accounting for 75% of the world's tigers.\nThese tigers now inhabit an area of 138,200 sq km (53,360 sq miles) - roughly half the size of the UK - alongside some 60 million people.\nThis has been made possible by safeguarding the big cats from poaching and habitat loss, securing prey, reducing human-wildlife conflict, and uplifting local communities, the study published inScience, a leading peer-reviewed research journal, says.\n\"We think human densities are detrimental to conservation of large carnivores [like tigers]. But more than density it is the attitude of people that matters,\"  Yadvendradev Vikramsinh Jhala, the study's lead author, told the BBC.\nHe cited Malaysia as an example, where, despite being economically prosperous and having a lower population density than India, tiger populations have not been successfully revived.\nIndia's tiger recovery shows how conservation can protect big cats, boost biodiversity, and support communities - offering key lessons for the world, the researchers believe.\nThe study by Mr Jhala, Ninad Avinash Mungi, Rajesh Gopal and Qamar Qureshi analysed tiger occupancy in India from 2006 to 2018.\nSince 2006, India has surveyed tiger habitats every four years across 20 states, monitoring distribution of the big cats, co-predators, prey, and quality of habitat.\nIn that time, its tiger habitat has grown by 30% - about 2,929 sq km annually.\nBut while tigers in the country have thrived in protected, prey-rich areas, they have also adapted to landscapes shared by nearly 60 million people, primarily living in farming communities and settlements outside tiger reserves and national parks.\nThe level of coexistence with tigers varies across India, influenced by economics, social settings, and cultural factors, the researchers found.\nIn states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, and Karnataka, tigers share space with people at high densities.\nIn regions with a history of bushmeat hunting or poaching, such as Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and northeast India, tigers are either absent or extinct. These areas also include some of India's poorest districts.\nIn other words, researchers note, tiger coexistence with people is often found in economically prosperous areas, which benefit from tiger-related tourism and government compensation for conflict losses.\nBut development can be a \"double-edged sword\", says Mr Jhala.\nThe researchers say economic prosperity through sustainable use of ecosystems helps recovery of tigers. However, it often leads to changes in land use that harm tiger habitats.\n\"Tiger recovery is thus constrained at opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, by intensive urbanisation and poverty,\" the researchers say.\n\"Hence, adopting an inclusive and sustainable rural prosperity in place of an intensive land-use change–driven economy can be conducive for tiger recovery, aligning with India's modern environmentalism and sustainability.\"\nArmed conflict also significantly increases risk of extinction of tigers, the researchers found.\nGlobally, political instability has led to drastic wildlife declines, as militants exploit wildlife for funding, turning lawless areas into poaching hotspots.\nIn India, Manas National Park lost its rhinos during conflict, mirroring Nepal's rhino decline during the civil unrest.\nThe researchers found tiger extinctions occurred in districts impacted by India's Maoist conflict, particularly in tiger reserves in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.\nReserves where the conflict has been controlled - Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam, Amrabad, and Similipal - have shown recovery, they say.\nAlso, several habitats in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and eastern Maharashtra have faced armed insurgencies, resulting in low tiger occupancy and high extinction risk, the researchers found.\n\"With improved political stability, these areas may see tiger recovery,\" they say.\nIndia's tiger-free habitats - some 157,000 sq km - are mainly in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Jharkhand. Reintroducing tigers and enhancing habitat connectivity in protected areas could restore around 10,000 sq km in these areas, the researcher say.\nRecovering large carnivores in crowded, poverty-stricken areas is challenging, researcher say.\nOne approach, land sparing, suggests keeping people separate from predators. The other, land sharing supports coexistence between humans and wildlife.\nCritics argue land sharing leads to conflict, while land sparing may be impractical. The study shows that both approaches - land sparing and land sharing - are necessary for tiger recovery in India, as each has a \"role in conserving large carnivores\".\nIndia is also grappling with rising human-wildlife conflict, leading to fatalities from tiger attacks. How does this align with the growing tiger population?\n\"We lose 35 people to tiger attacks every year, 150 to leopards, and the same number to wild pigs. Additionally, 50,000 people die from snake bites. And then about 150,000 also lose their lives in car accidents annually,\" says Mr Jhala.\n\"It's not about the number of deaths. Two hundred years ago, human deaths from predators were a normal part of mortality. Today, they're abnormal, which is why they make the headlines. In fact, within tiger reserves, you're more likely to die from a car accident than from a tiger attack.\"\nFull squad lists, as they are announced, for the 2025 Champions Trophy.\nHoshoryu, real name Sugarragchaa Byambasuren, became the 74th yokozuna after winning a major tournament last week.\nAt least 30 people died and several were injured in a crush at the religious festival in India this week.\nPolice are looking at all aspects of the case, including the possibility of an honour killing.\nThe star batter has been facing a lean patch and has struggled for consistency in recent years.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to \"pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes\" in his first address to the nation since the fall of ousted leader Bashar al-Assad.\nSharaa has been named president for a \"transitional period\", seven weeks after he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad.\nHe committed to issuing a \"constitutional declaration\" to serve as a \"legal reference\" during the country's transition, following the suspension of the old constitution.\nEarlier, rebel military commander Hassan Abdul Ghani announced the cancellation of Syria's 2012 constitution and the dissolution of the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies, according to the Sana news agency.\nSharaa began the pre-recorded speech by saying that he would be addressing his words to all Syrian men and women, including refugees, the families of \"martyrs\" and missing people, and activists who have dedicated their lives to the struggle for a free Syria.\nHe credited his coming to power to every Syrian who took part in the uprising and tried to make a change, and vowed to \"pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes\".\nHe also promised to hold a \"national dialogue conference\" and vowed to preserve \"civil peace\" and Syria's territorial unity.\nIt comes after announcements were made on Wednesday during an event in Damascus attended by the commanders of factions who fought alongside the rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It was entitled the \"Conference for Announcing the Victory of the Syrian Revolution\".\nAll rebel groups which opposed Assad in the 13-year civil war would be dissolved and integrated into state institutions, Sharaa said.\nAs president, Sharaa would form an interim legislative council to help govern until a new constitution was approved, Ghani said.\nIn late December, Sharaa told Al Arabiya TV in an interview that it would take up to four years to hold new elections.\nHe said an up-to-date census would be required first which \"would take time\" and that writing up a new constitution would also take up to three years to complete.\nSharaa also reiterated in the interview that he planned a \"national dialogue conference\", which he said would \"bring together all components\" of Syrian society.\nIn 2011, Assad brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.\nHTS - a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK - previously dominated the last rebel stronghold in north-western Syria.\nOn 8 December, as the rebels entered Damascus after routing the army and sweeping down from the north in the space of only 12 days, Assad resigned the presidency and fled to Russia.\nAn interim government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, the former head of the rebel administration in the north-west, has been tasked with running the country until March.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Syrian government called on Russia to address \"past mistakes\" by paying war reparations, during the first visit by a top Kremlin delegation since the fall of Assad, its staunch ally.\nSharaa and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov discussed \"rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as compensation, reconstruction and recovery\", Sana reported.\nThe Russian foreign ministry said its delegation expressed \"unwavering support\" for Syria's unity and readiness to assist its recovery from the civil war.\nThe Russian military carried out tens of thousands of air strikes on rebel-held areas after intervening in the conflict in support of Assad in 2015. A UK-based monitoring group says more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, were killed by those strikes and other Russian operations.\nSince the fall of the Assad regime, Russia has been withdrawing troops and weapons from its two bases on Syria's Mediterranean coast - Hmeimim airbase near Latakia and the naval base in Tartous.\nRecent satellite photos analysed by BBC Verify showed that two Russian warships were docked at Tartous, which experts said suggested an evacuation of the facility had begun.\nHowever, Russia is believed to be seeking to retain both bases, which give it a strategically important foothold in the eastern Mediterranean.\nFollowing the Russian delegation's visit to Damascus, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow: \"That was an important trip, and the contacts were important, too, because it is necessary to establish and maintain a constant dialogue with Syria.\"\nWhen asked about reports that the Syrian government had requested Assad's extradition and war reparations in return, he replied: \"I leave this without any comments. We will continue further dialogue with the Syrian authorities.\"\nIn the interview with Al Arabiya, Sharaa noted the \"deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria\" and said he did not want Russia to leave \"in a way that undermines its relationship with our country\".\n\"All of Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts,\" he added.\nAdditional reporting by Lina Sinjab in Damascus\nMoscow had moved columns of military vehicles to the port after the fall of Bashar al-Assad.\nA satellite image taken 21 January shows new construction within the demilitarised zone.\nAnalysts say the return suggests that Moscow is preparing to evacuate one of its most valuable overseas bases.\nLandmines are hindering the safe return of Syrians after the fall of the Assad regime.\nDebra Tice says she has \"no idea\" where her son is following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime.",

    "text": "The death of a 94-year-old woman who died after a board advertising Weston-super-Mare's Grand Pier fell on her, has been ruled as an accident by a coroner.\nMargaret Carter of Lydney, Gloucestershire, had been walking along the promenade  on 28 October 2021 when the heavy A-frame, which had been left out in \"gale force\" winds, landed on top of her.\nShe faced a three-and-a-half hour wait for an ambulance while on the ground in poor weather conditions and died after being taken to Southmead Hospital.\nCoroner, Peter Harrowing, said that the death had been an accident \"neither intended nor envisioned by the individuals who placed that sign... or by the company by which they were employed\".\nGrand Pier Ltd hadalready pleaded guiltyto criminal health and safety failings over the death and was ordered to pay almost £200,000 in January 2024.\nMrs Carter has been described by her family as having been \"independent\" and \"completely fit in both body and mind\" and determined to live to 100.\nHer son, Michael Carter, said: \"She was the most wonderful person, full of life and energy, even at the age of 94.\"\nHe attended the inquest at Avon Coroner's Court with his sister Sue Firman.\nThe inquest heard that Mrs Carter had been visiting Weston-super-Mare, her favourite place to visit, with family on the October day in 2021.\nShe had been walking along the promenade at about noon when a strong gust of wind hit the flat face of the A-board, which was more than 2m high and weighed about 100kg, blowing it over and onto her.\nAn ambulance was called but did not arrive for three and a half hours.\nSouth Western Ambulance Service said at the time that handover delays were putting strain on the service, and she was initially not categorised as high priority.\nThe inquest heard that the impact of her injuries led to heart failure, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.\nA statement read out from Dr Delaney, who examined her at Southmead Hospital, said: \"In my opinion, these significant injuries would have created a high risk of death in an elderly person, even with more rapid medical intervention.\"\nThe inquest was told that on the day of the incident, wind speeds were as high as 39mph, which as a rule of thumb could be called \"gale force.\"\nThe A-boards have not been used since the incident. They were seized by North Somerset Council and Grand Pier Ltd told the court they did not want them back.\nThe co-owner and director of Grand Pier Ltd, Michelle Michael, said that the company had now engaged a health and safety practitioner to advise and perform spot checks and all senior management had taken a health and safety qualification.\nMr Carter said: \"We are just pleased as a family that the pier have put measures in place in an effort to prevent this happening again in the future, which is ultimately the best that we could hope for.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "text": "A nature reserve in East Yorkshire has seen a resurgence in numbers of a rare bird that nearly disappeared from the UK.\nRSPB Blacktoft Sands, in Goole, has experienced a record year in the breeding of bearded tits, also known as \"beardies\", which came dangerously close to extinction in the UK in the 1940s.\nAround 120 pairs of the small, reedbed bird produced 500 young last year at the reserve – more than double the breeding success rate of previous years.\nPete Short, RSPB Humber Estuary reserves manager, said seeing the orangey-brown, long-tailed birds at the reserve was a \"special nature spectacle\".\nIn 1948, the English population of bearded tits was thought to be down to just two pairs at RSPB Minsmere, the society said.\nThe population then grew to about 100 pairs in south-east England in the early 1960s and have nearly doubled over the past 25 years.\nThe RSPB said the resurgence was down to 25 years of dedicated reedbed management at Blacktoft, including winter reed cutting.\nMr Short said: \"Watching our bearded tits darting around the reedbeds is a special nature spectacle.\n\"Carefully managing wetlands is important for some of our rarest species and we're delighted that our management of the reedbeds is paying off.\n\"Wetlands are important to us all and without them we would lose so much.\"\nListen to highlights fromHull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch thelatest episode of Look Northor tell us about a story you think we should be coveringhere.\nEnvironmental experts want dogs and people to be banned at certain spots in the island.\nOne Scottish council says it has plan to try and prevent the birds being a health and safety risk.\nFootage of the bird standing on the verge in Bedworth Road, Bulkington, was posted on social media.\nUS President Donald Trump says that wind farms harm birds and whales.

    "text": "Leicester City boss Ruud van Nistelrooy has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game againstEverton(kick-off 15:00 GMT).\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\nLong-term absentee Ricardo Pereira, who is recovering from a hamstring injury, is still in \"individual training\" with the physiotherapists but he is now training on the grass. The full-back's rehabilitation is \"going to plan\".\nWilfred Ndidi is \"making good progress\" and is \"partially back in team training\". He hopes the defensive midfielder will be back in full team training over the coming week.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been in team training this week and could be in contention for selection on Saturday.\nVan Nistelrooy praised Jakub Stolarczyk for doing an \"excellent job\" when called upon in recent games: \"He has shown the progression he has made into a proper Premier League goalkeeper, so we are also very happy that we have developed him over these games.\"\nOn whether the Tottenham win has inspired his players, Van Nistelrooy offered: \"I don't feel a difference in training intensity. We have been demanding these standards from the start, so we are stable because the result is a win but the next week then starts. Of course, three points away from home is big for us.\"\nHe is expecting a tough away atmosphere at Goodison Park: \"I know what it is like to play there. I also know that in every away game in the Premier League, you are going to face circumstances where the crowd is a factor. With the experience we have in our team, we are able to handle that. We have to perform in those circumstances.\"\nThe club is still working on \"a couple of things\" before the transfer deadline on Monday night, with Van Nistelrooy stating: \"We know there is a deadline and that's what we are working towards. It is something that we are going to address until the last second of the window to see what we can do.\"\nHe was hesitant to confirm whether the club is looking at permanent deals or loan deals, but he added: \"We are trying to do the maximum possible, within the possibilities, to get players in that can strengthen this team. If we can get something then great. If not then we carry on with this group.\"\nOn the reasoning behind Hamza Choudhury's loan to Sheffield United: \"He is a senior player that needs minutes. We have four midfielders in his position so that made his minutes lower. It was important for him to play and he also wanted that to show himself. It is good for the club and the player so, in that sense, it is a good move.\"\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

However, he said that it was \"not my first thought\" for a solution.\nWhen asked if he was confident Everton would be able to bring in new faces before the end of the January transfer window, he said: \"Confidence at the moment has become difficult because it's certainly not for the want of trying. I know behind the scenes and for all the Evertonians, we are really out there trying to find players we can bring in. Ultimately, we are still hampered by PSR [profit and sustainability rules].\"\nMore on the limits PSR is having on him and the club: \"I've got to say, I have been really surprised in the way it is restricting the football club. Everton is a huge football club and it should be competing with many of the big clubs in the country here, hopefully spending in a way that is right and challenging for the big players who are out there and available. We hope to bring in some players but maybe not the ones that, if we had the money, we would be trying to do.\"\nFollow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "text": "News that Brighton would be willing to sell Evan Ferguson rather than just loan him out during the current transfer window hints at a big decision from Fabian Hurzeler.\nEven a couple of weeks ago, there was debate around Ferguson, partly because of the injury records of strikers Danny Welbeck and Joao Pedro, but also because of the Irishman's age and the knowledge that, at 20, he is nowhere near his prime.\nEvidently, if Brighton sell Ferguson, it will mean his prime will be reached elsewhere, even if I would expect experienced operators like Tony Bloom and Paul Barber to be negotiating a pretty huge sell-on clause.\nBy definition, that means Hurzeler does not feel he has any use for the forward.\nThat is a bit of a surprise. And while no-one has said there is a breakdown in the pair's relationship, clearly Brighton's young boss is not prepared to wait for Ferguson to rediscover his best form.",

There's a rich history and a massive rivalry there over the last number of years.\n\"We'd had a pretty good run [last year], fourth round going in over there and there was a lot of belief. We also respected them massively and knew that there was a big performance brewing from them.\n\"They obviously hadn't gone so well at that point but you look back six months prior to that and they're in a World Cup final [semi-final].\n\"It's similar now in that they've been on the wrong side of some of their results in the autumn but we have massive respect for them as a team and the quality in their squad.\"\nDespite winning three of four Tests in the autumn, there was a feeling that Ireland had not hit top form themselves in November.\nHandling issues and a slew of penalty concessions were evident in a defeat to New Zealand and victories over Argentina and Australia.\nWhen asked for areas improvement, Doris talked about discipline, the line-out and scrum, as well as the attack and breakdown, before noting he had \"mentioned basically the whole game\".\nHe added: \"But there is that feeling that there is growth from individuals, from us as a collective across the board, and that's the exciting thing for us.\"",

    "text": "Members of a family who were jailed for allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer physical harm have had their convictions overturned at the Court of Appeal.\nAsgar Sheikh and his parents Khalid and Shabnam were jailed in February 2024 after they were convicted following a trial at Leeds Crown Court. Asgar's sister Shagufa was given a suspended sentence.\nThe victim, Asgar's wife Ambreen, survives in a persistent vegetative state, the trial heard.\nHowever, an appeal hearing concluded the case against the defendants was \"riddled with evidential difficulties\".\nBarristers representing the four at the Court of Appeal hearing on 4 December argued the trial judge, Mrs Justice Lambert, \"misconstrued\" the relevant section of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act which the defendants were convicted under.\nThis, they argued, \"led her into error\" in rejecting the defence barristers' argument there was no case to answer.\nIt could also have led her to \"fail to direct the jury appropriately as to its application to the facts\", they added.\nThe argument related to the administration of the anti-diabetes drug glimepiride to Ambreen which caused a catastrophic brain injury, and whether the family members should have foreseen it and acted to prevent it.\nThe trial heard Ambreen had earlier suffered a severe burn to her lower back, but the prosecution could not prove who in the household had caused the injury.\nOne of the factors required to prove someone is guilty of causing or allowing the death or serious injury of a vulnerable adult or child is that the unlawful act causing their death or serious injury occurred in circumstances that the defendant foresaw, or ought to have foreseen.\nThe trial heard expert medical evidence that glimepiride was \"very, very rarely\" known to be used as a \"weapon\" to deliberately harm someone.\nHowever, the Court of Appeal judges said there was \"nothing in the ruling which indicates that [Mrs Justice] Lambert had regard to [this] evidence\".\nThe judges reviewing the case said Mrs Justice Lambert should have \"specifically addressed the question of intent in the administration of a noxious substance\" in relation to the glimepiride in her summing-up to the jury.\nThe Court of Appeal said there was not enough evidence for the jury to have reasonably concluded there was malicious intent in administering the drug, or that the earlier injury to Ambreen indicated its use had been intended to achieve the same aim of \"humiliating\" her.\nThe Court of Appeal hearing concluded that the argument of \"no case to answer\" put forward by the defence at the original trial \"should have succeeded\".\nDuring the trial, jurors were told the victim only survived by being fed through a tube and would eventually die as a consequence of what happened to her.\nAfter the jury returned guilty verdicts Asgar, then 31, Khalid, then 55, and Shabnam, then 52, were jailed for seven years and nine months. They have now been released from prison, the Ministry of Justice confirmed.\nShagufa, then 29, was given an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years.\nAsgar, Khalid, Shabnam and Shagufa did not appeal against their convictions for perverting the course of justice in relation to their delay in seeking medical assistance and concealing the circumstances of Ambreen's lapse into unconsciousness.\nListen to highlights fromWest Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look Northor tell us a story you thinkwe should be covering here.\nTrial at Bradford Crown Court hears text messages allegedly sent could not be recovered.\nPolice are seeking a suspect after a boy was reportedly kissed in the Fartown area of Huddersfield.\nStaff in Huddersfield have been offered terms less generous than their peers, Unite says.\nA Huddersfield officer denies three counts of assault during work social events.\nRichard Royston was last seen in his home town of Huddersfield over three years ago, police say.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "Spanish La Liga, European Football, Real Madrid, UEFA Champions League, Football",
    "text": "The rest of Europe have been warned - Real Madrid are back.\nAnd back as the stadium-filling rock legends that we know them to be, as opposed to the enthusiastic, discordant high school band they have looked like for so much of the season.\nCarlo Ancelotti's beat Brest 3-0 on Wednesday in the final match of the Champions League league phase and will now face either Manchester City or Celtic in a mouth-watering play-off.\nSince being destroyed 5-2 by Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup, Real have won their past five matches, scoring 20 goals, and are top of La Liga by four points.\nAn indifferent start to the campaign, including some inconsistent form and questions around the dynamic of the side with new superstar signing Kylian Mbappe, saw plenty of criticism directed towards boss Ancelotti.\n\"Ancelotti is leaving the club in the summer\", \"Mbappe can't settle\", \"Vinicius Jr is unsettled\" - people were asking what was going on at Real.\nBut the demise of the European giants has been exaggerated.\nAncelotti has never been unduly bothered by the opinions of people outside of the club, although this time he sensed there were elements emanating from within.\nReal Madrid have already lifted the Uefa Super Cup this season\nWhen one Spanish radio announced Ancelotti had told the club this season would be his last, they jumped the gun and he wasted no time in issuing a swift denial.\nBut Ancelotti will be the one to decide when he leaves the club, despite the year and a half left in his contract. After four years and 11 trophies - including two Champions League successes - he has earned the right to.\nIt also explains his slight smugness when informing the media that, after stating they were no good at all, their current league performances suggest the critics were wrong.\nWhat is certain is that no-one is better placed than him to know when the time is right to walk away - and that will be when he believes he can no longer find the necessary solutions to ensure the continual arrival of trophies at the club.\nAt that point he will allow Florentino Perez to prepare the way for a new arrival - more likely than not Xabi Alonso, who always thought that Real or Liverpool would be his next steps if things went well with Bayer Leverkusen.\nBut not just yet.\nAncelotti has always believed Real would win titles this season, especially if they managed to overcome the inherent laziness that can often follow on from a Champions League and La Liga winning campaign.\nIt's worth noting that they still haven't beaten any of the top sides this season, including defeats by AC Milan and Liverpool in the Champions League and having nine thumped past them in their two encounters against Barcelona.\nAncelotti, though, remains unwavering in his belief.\n'It's an opportunity' - what is at stake for Man City?\nChampions League set for dramatic finale - how it stands\nInjuries, particularly in defence to the likes of Eder Militao and Dani Carvajal, did not help matters at the start.\nBut Ancelotti's main problems lay in the lack of a midfield to control games and the unwillingness of any of the stellar front three to put in a shift tracking back. And Jude Bellingham did not know where to run to cover so much ground.\nThe renewed vigour being displayed by Dani Ceballos in midfield has helped, but it is their displays in attack that have really made the difference to Real's fortunes.\nWhere to begin with Vinicius Jr, who seems to be the focus of everyone's attention whether playing or not.\nThe Brazil attacker has been in and out of the line-up recently, either through injury or suspension, and is currently the subject of a colossal offer from Saudi Arabia.\nThe story has been allowed to 'gain legs' by the Real decision makers who control the agenda, thanks to a compliant Madrid media who will focus on it for as long as it suits the club for them to do so.\nThe money injected by the sale of the 24-year-old would go a long way to paying for the stadium debt, along with a number of other financial benefits.\nReal would certainly not be scared of selling the player, but the timing has to be right.\nMuch has been made about what is seen as Vinicius' confrontational approach to taunts from opposition fans.\nIn the latest incident, he responded to chants of \"tonto\" (stupid) from Valencia supporters earlier this month by making a hand gesture suggesting the La Liga strugglers are going to be relegated.\nIn his defence, no single player I have seen has received the level of abuse that is dished out to him, includingnumerous examples of racism from fans.\nAnyone expecting a bowed head and closed mouth reaction from Vinicius is going to have a lengthy wait.\nHe believes the abuse he receives is as unjust as it is fundamentally racist and not something he is prepared to endure.\nOn the field, Vinicius' developing understanding with Mbappe is another of the reasons for Real's improved performances.\nThe Frenchman had a tricky start to his Madrid career, but it is becoming clearer by the day that Real's success will revolve around making Mbappe the main goalscoring focus - and leader.\nMbappe was always too intelligent, too talented and too precocious to fail, or buckle under the pressure, at Real Madrid.\nHe originally saw playing as a number nine as a more static role than he does now, and was conscious of not being seen to invade Vinicius' space - on and off the pitch - even going as far as accepting that penalties would be rotated.\nThese days wherever he appears on the pitch the team adapt to him accordingly. He has also accepted that as a number nine he can be lethal, not so much with his back to goal but by running in behind and finishing clinically.\nSince missing a penalty against Athletic Club on 4 December, he has scored 12 goals, including his first hat-trick.\nHe is now the club's official penalty taker. And even Vinicius admitted the team will do all they can so Mbappe becomes the top scorer in both La Liga and the Champions League.\nAlso in a rich vein of form is Brazil forward Rodrygo, with 10 goals in his past 10 games, having gone two and a half months without a goal previously.\nThe self-doubts and feelings that he was not valued or appreciated at the club have been replaced with a new-found confidence\nAny wishes he might have had to leave have since vanished, not least because Ancelotti has confirmed to him that he sees him as a big match player and an automatic starter.\nThen, we have Bellingham, whose stock continues to rise.\nDespite playing with niggling injuries, the England man is without doubt the oil that is currently greasing the Real machine.\nWhether driving forward with the ball or creating from the edge of the box with his back to goal - linking up, assisting or scoring - he is clearly enjoying himself.\nEveryone's best friend at the team, Bellingham has, alongside Mbappe, already established himself as one of the two leaders at Real Madrid.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "text": "This video can not be played\nOlusanya torments Aberdeen in St Mirren win\nToyosi Olusanya is enjoying the most fruitful season of his career. And St Mirren fans should enjoy the striker while they can as a summer exit looks likely.\nThe 27-year-old hasresisted the club's attemptsto extend his contract and manager Stephen Robinson admitted in November he was fighting a losing battle to keep him.\nOlusanya was on the money for St Mirren again last weekend, scoring the opener in a 3-0 victory at Aberdeen to take his season's goal tally in all competitions to 11. He is the club's top marksman by a distance - Oisin Smyth is next most prolific on four goals.\nOlusanya's electric pace and strength are a key weapon for Robinson's side, but his Saints career has been a slow burner.\nHe joined in summer 2022, only to suffer a catalogue of injury problems before being farmed out on loan to Arbroath.\nLast term - his his first full season with the Saints - the Englishman grew more impactful, netting seven goals in 42 games.\nThis season, he has blossomed, coming up with big goals in Conference League qualifying, the Premiership and Scottish Cup.\nHis seven goals put him at the top end of the scorer charts in the league - outside of the Old Firm, only Sam Dalby, Bruce Anderson and Simon Murray have netted more.\nOlusanya's shot conversion rate in the Premiership has also taken a leap from 15.4% last season to 17.1%, putting him among the top 12 players. Plus he's in the top 10 for touches in the opposition box and only two non-Old Firm players (Lawrence Shankland and Dalby) have had more.\nOlusanya has had 15 big chances in the league so far this term and scored seven of them. By way of comparison, recently departed Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi only scored nine from 26 chances while Daizen Maeda has five from 17.\nSince the Paisley club's return to the top flight in 2018, no St Mirren player has scored more than Jamie McGrath's 17-goal haul in season 2020-21. With nearly four months of the campaign remaining, might Olusanya top that feat?",

He's one generation away from these players,\" Roberts said.\n\"A lot of these young players would have grown up watching him, and watching how brilliant he was for Wales on the pitch.\n\"Regardless of his scrummaging excellence and his coaching, his presence around this group will be invaluable.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFormer Wales prop Adam Jones backs 'calm' under-pressure Gatland\nThe combination of 80,000 passionate fans and the sheer size of Stade de France makes it one of sport's most intimidating arenas.\nBut Wales can take confidence from their record there. They have won five of their past 12 matches away to Les Bleus, more than any of the other visiting Six Nations teams.\nJones and Roberts have mixed feelings about the Paris stadium.\n\"France on a Friday night, it's one of the best rugby experiences in the game,\" said Roberts.\n\"I get asked about my favourite stadium to play in the world, obviously Cardiff, the Principality Stadium is amazing. Top of the list for me, though, is the Stade de France.\"\nJones said: \"It's not my favourite stadium because it feels quite far away and when you look up it's so big.\n\"There's some young guys there who won't have experienced that.\"\nTom Shanklin (left), Jamie Roberts (centre) and Alun Wyn Jones (right) all enjoyed stellar international careers\nFrance v Wales match preview, coverage & key stats\nWales' whole focus cannot be on Dupont - Gatland\nWilliams, Adams and Jenkins return for Wales' Six Nations opener\nFrance, considered by many as tournament favourites, have been bolstered by the return of fit-again Romain Ntamack, while Antoine Dupont is back on Six Nations duty having missed the tournament in 2024.\nBut Shanklin thinks there is no better time to play the French.\n\"We're coming into this campaign off the back of some good regional performances which will help a little bit of confidence, a little bit of self-belief,\" he said.\n\"You've got to cling on to the positives because if you look at the two teams, France and Wales, they are just not comparable.\n\"Part of me thinks it's the best time to play France... Sometimes you want to get teams before they get too much momentum. But it's also a tough one because we're going in cold as well.\"\nAn optimistic Jones predicts Wales to win by two points.\n\"We're unbeaten in 2025,\" he joked, with Wales yet to play in this calendar year.\n\"It's a positive thing, it's not meant to be tongue in cheek, because as players they will want to move on as well.\"\nBut Jones warned this French side are different than many in the past, in that Wales  will know which which opponent will turn up.\n\"They've got a bit more structure, they don't seem as aloof. Once they've scored they want to score again, they don't sit back,\" he said.\n\"It's going to be a tough ask, but it's funny what can happen.\"\nRomain Ntamack and Antoine Dupont play together at Toulouse\nThe pundits agree that cancelling out the threat of Dupont at scrum-half will be key to Welsh prospects.\n\"If we can get to Dupont, legally obviously, if we can try to affect his rhythm, that will be some way of doing it,\" said Jones.\n\"You've got to try to tackle him, get him on the deck, as soon as he passes there is no problem having a tackle committed,\" added Roberts.\n\"Make sure he's a second or two slower to the next ruck.\n\"I think Wales have just got to be brave.\"\nShanklin believes Wales also have a good chance in the aerial battle.\n\"Josh Adams, Liam Williams and Tom Rogers are all amazing in the air,\" he said.\n\"I think kicking to challenge will be huge.\"\nIt is a question that pops us before any campaign - what would success be?\nWales are away to France, Italy and Scotland this year, with home games against England and Ireland.\nRecognising that Wales are the current wooden spoon holders, Shanklin has set his sights low, targeting just the one win.\n\"If you look at last year, I think success in this campaign would be seeing a better style of attack, but the main one would be Italy away, winning one game, that's where we are.\"\nJones, again, was more optimistic.\n\"I think at least two or three [wins], that could be pie in the sky, but if it clicks...\" he said.\n\"It could be a difficult watch but there's players that are back and if we play the right way we could actually sneak a couple.\"\nRoberts says Wales have to target their home games.\n\"Never write Wales off at home against England or Ireland,\" he said.\n\"[Cardiff] is a really tough place to come and win. I know last year Wales didn't show that, but a new year and a new opportunity.\"\nThe British and Irish Lions won the 2013 Test series against Australia 2-1\nNot that the Six Nations needs any sub-plots, but this being a British and Irish Lions year adds a little extra spice.\nHead coach Andy Farrell and his backroom staff will be keeping a close eye on the home nations ahead of this summer's tour of Australia.\n\"Any player who tells you they're not thinking about it, they're lying,\" said Roberts, who toured with the Lions in 2009 and 2013.\n\"You start looking across your peers, and looking across to other countries and think 'right I've got to up my game here'. There's always that motivation.\"\nFormer Lions captain and four-time tourist Jones said he tried not to think about selection until the year arrived.\n\"You take your eye off what it is you're actually doing day to day, week to week, you can put pressure on yourself,\" he said.\n\"Ultimately if you're good enough you're going to be on the radar anyways.\"",

    "text": "A range of Coca-Cola products have been recalled in the UK after the firm's bottling partner said it had identified \"elevated levels\" of a chemical called chlorate.\nCans of Coca-Cola Original Taste, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke, and Sprite Zero sent to cafes and restaurants are being withdrawn as well as 6x250ml Appletiser multipacks sent to UK supermarkets.\nThe announcement followsa larger recall of Coca-Cola products across Europe on Monday.\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners, the firm's bottling partner, said the risk of illness was \"very low\".\nThe affected cans carry production codes from 328 GE to 338 GE on their base.\nThe majority of Coca-Cola products, including standard cans, and all glass and plastic bottles sold in the UK are not affected, the firm said.\nThe UK recall comes after Coca-Cola products were pulled from the shelves in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on Monday.\nThe higher levels of chlorate were discovered during routine testing at the company's production facility in Ghent, Belgium, according to an unnamed company spokesperson quoted by the AFP news agency.\nCoca-Cola said at the time just five product lines had been shipped to Britain, and they had already been sold. It added it had \"alerted the authorities\".\nHowever, on Wednesday, the firm confirmed a UK recall \"following ongoing dialogue with the UK Food Standards Agency\".\nChlorate can be produced when chlorine-based disinfectants are used in water treatment and food processing.\nExposure to high levels of chlorate can cause health problems including thyroid problems, especially among children and infants.\nNHS and private nutritionist Caron Grazette told the BBC on Monday: \"We need to question whether or not we want to digest chemicals in soft drinks which are used in the production of fireworks and disinfectants, however small the quantity\".\nChlorate's effects on humans when taken in excess include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and limiting the blood's ability to absorb oxygen, added Ms Grazette, citing recent research into the chemical.\nBut the company said the risk to consumers was small.\n\"Independent expert analysis concluded that any associated risk of feeling temporarily unwell from consuming these products is very low,\" Coca-Cola Europacific Partners said.\n\"The quality and safety of our products is our top priority and we're sorry that on this occasion, a small number of our products have not met our high standards, and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused,\" it said, in a statement.\nThe company says the drinks contain \"higher levels\" of chlorate, but says the risk is \"very low\".\nProtesters blocked the drink brand's float, causing the parade to be rerouted.\nConsumer bodies say firms make misleading claims about plastic water bottles being \"100% recycled\".\nCoca-Cola hopes to cut its carbon footprint with fossil-free plastic trial at Swansea University.\nThe World Bank says many years of financial support are needed as London hosts a major conference.",

    "text": "A government planning inspector has ordered the clearance of tens of thousands of tonnes of illegally dumped waste on land at Borstal near Rochester.\nJohn Treeby of Factory Farm had appealed against a Medway Council planning enforcement notice issued in December 2022.\nHowever, the inspector rejected the appeal and ordered Mr Treeby to clear the site within three months.\nThe Environment Agency has estimated there to be more than 34,000 cubic metres of shredded waste containing plastics, soil, timber, glass, organics and aggregates.\nLocal residents have spoken of a steady stream of tipper lorries visiting the site over a number of years.\nIn her decision, planning inspector Hilda Higenbottom, said: \"The importation of waste, reprofiling of the land, creation of the installation of a hardstanding have all introduced significant visually harmful elements into what was once a paddock/grassed area.\n\"As such, the development fails to conserve or enhance the landscape or scenic beauty of the national landscape.\"\nMr Treeby was also ordered to clear an adjacent area of vehicle breaking, waste processing and caravans within nine months.\nThe BBC has approached Mr Treeby for comment.\nIn March 2024 a spokesperson for Mr Treeby said he had not given anyone permission to tip on his land.\n\"This occurred during a time when he was hospitalised for a life limiting illness and during a time of grief when he lost his son during a car accident.\n\"He was subsequently the victim of an armed robbery where he and his family were tied up in their home, beaten with guns and robbed,\" they said.\n\"He has been the victim of land grab and we are actively pursuing options to secure the land to prevent this happening again.\"\nMeanwhile, in an unconnected case, two men received suspended prison sentences earlier in January for filling a warehouse in Margate with 6,000 bales of waste, the Environment Agency said.\nDavid Weekes and Lee Brookes built up the stockpile of plastic wrapped rubbish in a unit on the Westwood Business Park before the building and the waste burned down in September 2018.\nWeekes, 55, of Pillar Avenue, Brixham, Devon, was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years at a hearing at Canterbury Crown Court on 21 January.\nHe was also ordered to pay £5,000 in costs and a victim surcharge of £140 while completing 150 hours unpaid work and 20 days of rehabilitation activity.\nWeekes was also made to temporarily wear an electronic tag to monitor his daytime movements.\nBrookes, of Nelson Street, Middleton, Manchester, received a sentence of four months in prison, suspended for a year.\nThe 48-year-old was also given 80 hours of unpaid work, the same 20 days of rehabilitation programme, and was ordered to pay costs of £1,000 and a £115 victim surcharge.\nFollow BBC Kent onFacebook, onX, and onInstagram.

    "title": "Electric planes, new fuel: Can Heathrow's third runway be green?",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The government has backed the construction of a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced the decision in aspeech on measures aimed at improving economic growth, saying that the case for the expansion \"is stronger than ever\".\nThe expansion of Heathrow has long been opposed by green groups and her announcement will be extremely controversial, not least because of its environmental impact.\nReeves claimedat the weekend that \"a lot has changed in aviation\" since plans for a new runway at Heathrow were first discussed decades ago.\nShe said \"sustainable aviation fuel\" would cut emissions, that there was huge investment going into electric planes, and that a third runway would mean fewer planes circling over London as pilots wait to land.\nBut the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), has repeatedly cautioned against airport expansion without a framework in place to manage overall national capacity.\nMeanwhile, advocates of the expansion say it is vital for boosting growth - not least because demand is outstripping supply. Heathrow has no free landing slots available, meaning airlines have to buy slots from competitors if they want to expand their services.\nBBC Verify has assessed Reeves' claims about impact on the environment to see whether the government's reasoning stacks up.\nBy burning traditional jet fuel - kerosene - aircraft release carbon dioxide, a planet-warming gas.\n\"Sustainable\" fuels are alternatives to fossil fuels, made from renewable sources. They can come from agricultural waste and from used cooking oil.\nThe government argues they emit 70% less carbon emissions over the course of their lifetime. This is because the plants from which the fuels are often derived wereabsorbing carbon dioxide from the atmospherewhen they were growing.\nThe previous government announced thatby 2030, 10% of all jet fuelused in flights taking off from the UK must be sustainable as a way to reduce the impact of aviation on emissions. This target has been kept by Labour and it is increasing funding into sustainable fuels.\nBut there are a number of issues with using the rollout of these as a justification for airport expansion.\nSustainable fuels are currently used in a tiny fraction of jet fuel - the government target for 2025 is 2% - and scaling this up will be a major challenge. They are not completely carbon-neutral because of the energy used in producing, refining and transporting them and can vary widely between fuel types.\nMany environmentalists arguethat expanding UK airports is incompatible with the UK's net zero targets because there is currently no viable widespread alternative to fossil-fuel based aviation fuel for powering planes.\nProvisional official figures show that greenhouse gas emissions from UK international aviation in 2023 were32.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. That was roughly 8% of the UK's total greenhouse gas emissions (including international aviation) of 423.3 million tonnes in that year.\nAside from a major dip in the pandemic, there has been no substantial change in emissions from UK international air travel over the past 20 years.\nIn recent years, the growth of UK international aviation emissions has actually been lower than the increase in passengers flying in and out of UK airports.\nThis has been partiallyattributed to more fuel-efficient planes. But it is unclear if this trend would continue with a third Heathrow runway.\nAnd there are questions about theeffectiveness of airlines' schemes to \"offset\" emissionsby decarbonising elsewhere, like planting trees.\nThere are already a number ofsmall battery-powered electric planesand investment in the technology is increasing.\nIf planes are powered by electricity generated from renewables like wind and solar, flying could result in zero carbon emissions.\nBut the weight of batteries is currently regarded as a major obstacle to a large-scale expansion of electric-powered flights, particularly for long haul journeys.\nTechnological breakthroughs in battery weights are possible, but widespread electric air travel is not seen as a realistic prospect in the near future by most analysts.\nHeathrow Airport has reported thatin 2023 an average of 232 aircraft, more than a third of all arriving planes, were held in one of four \"stacks\" above London each day, where they circle at or above 7,000 feet until there is space to land at the airport. They spent an average of 6.85 minutes in a stack.\nCircling at low altitude is less fuel efficient than cruising at high altitude, because of extra air resistance.\nAs a result, since 2014 Heathrow and air traffic control company Nats have been working with their counterparts across Europe to slow inbound flights down from as far as 350 miles away, when delays over London begin to build.\nBut it is difficult to estimate whether an extra Heathrow runway would reduce stacking, let alone reduce emissions.\nThe BBC has asked NATS for updated figures on how circling times over Heathrow have been changing and the impact on emissions, and we asked the Treasury for further details about the chancellor's claim about circling flights.\nAdditional reporting by Gerry Georgieva and Mark Poynting\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletterto get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "title": "Marianne Faithfull, the 60s icon who carved her own path",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "By her own admission, Marianne Faithfull,who has died aged 78, \"didn't do conventional\".\nShe was the convent-educated teenager who abandoned school after meeting the Rolling Stones.\nA delicate-featured picture of innocence, she inhaled the highs of chart success, before falling victim to alcohol and hard drugs.\nAfter splitting up with Mick Jagger, Faithfull spent years living as a heroin addict on the streets of Soho.\nGiven the chance to restart her singing career, she went on to make more than 20 albums.\nHer whisky-soaked voice, turned cracked and dusky, conveyed the inner torments of her painful life-experiences.\nMarianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull was born in Hampstead on 29 December 1946.\nHer mother was Baroness Eva Sacher-Masoch, a Hungarian, half-Jewish former ballet dancer who had fled the Nazis in World War II.\nHer father was Major Glyn Faithfull, an eccentric British MI6 agent turned professor of Italian literature.\nThe stage was set for an unusual childhood.\nMarianne spent her early years at Braziers Park, an upmarket commune founded by her father in an Oxfordshire country house.\nIn her autobiography, she described it as a \"mixture of high utopian thoughts and randy sex\".\nAfter divorcing, Lady Sacher-Masoch spirited her six-year-old daughter to a terraced house in Reading, discouraging further contact with Major Faithfull.\nAccording to Marianne, she was raised like \"one of her mother's cats\".\nShe had regular bouts of tuberculosis and was sent to St Joseph's Roman Catholic boarding school, despite her father's complaints that the nuns would \"give her a problem with sex for the rest of her life\".\nWhile still at school, Marianne began singing folk songs a cappella in Reading coffee-houses - and, before long, her exquisite looks and obvious talent saw her sucked into the vortex of Swinging 60s London.\nIn 1964, she attended a Rolling Stones launch party, on the arm of British artist John Dunbar, and was spotted by the flamboyant record producer Andrew Loog Oldham.\nFamously, he described her as an \"angel\" with impressive vital statistics.\nOldham was the Rolling Stones' manager and felt he could package his new discovery as a pop star.\nShe would, he thought, be a useful vehicle for songs that weren't quite a fit for his more important act.\nThe Rolling Stones were a rhythm and blues band. When singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote a gentle ballad, When Tears Go By, they dismissed it as a \"piece of tripe\".\nSo Oldham gave it to Marianne Faithfull.\nThe song had not been written for her but, she said, \"fitted me so perfectly it might as well had been\".\nThe melancholy classic, sung in her detached, wintry voice, reached the UK Top 10.\nThe Stones were so disappointed they had missed a hit, they recorded their own version a year later.\nFaithfull followed up with a series of singles, including Summer Nights, This Little Bird and - her highest chart success - Come and Stay with Me.\nShe caught Bob Dylan's eye when he came to town.\nInspired by her doe-eyed looks, the American singer-songwriter wrote her a poem - but tore it up when she turned him down.\nIn 1965, she married John Dunbar and gave birth to their son. Soon afterwards, she left the family home and moved in with Mick Jagger.\nHe was not Faithfull's first Rolling Stone. \"I slept with three of them,\" she later admitted, \"and then I decided the lead singer was the best bet.\"\nHer influence on the band was significant.\nLet's Spend the Night Together, You Can't Always Get What You Want and Wild Horses were all songs said to have been written about her.\nAnd Sympathy for the Devil was inspired by The Master and Margarita, a Russian novel Faithfull introduced to Jagger.\nAs one of the faces of the 1960s, Faithfull carved out a side-career as an actor.\nShe appeared at London's Royal Court in an adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson.\nShe became the first person ever to utter the F-word in a mainstream film, I'll Never Forget What'sisname, in 1967.\nA year later, she starred opposite Alain Delon, as a doomed, leather-clad beauty in The Girl on a Motorcycle.\nHer character's psychedelic and erotic fantasies saw the film win the first ever X-rating in the United States.\nOf course, there were a lot of drugs.\nDuring a police raid on Keith Richards' house in Sussex, Faithfull was discovered naked, draped in a fur rug - which she took indecent pleasure in occasionally letting slip.\nAllegations involving a Mars bar, she insisted, were entirely made up. But the drugs bust took a toll on her reputation. \"It destroyed me,\" she later said.\n\"To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising, she explained.\n\"A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\"\nFaithfull co-wrote Sister Morphine with Jagger and Richards and released the song in 1969.\nThe lyrics - the authorship of which were later the subject of a legal dispute with the band - are a terrifying insight into the effect of heroin and cocaine addiction: \"The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears. Tell me, Sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?\"\nThe relationship with Jagger - whom she accused of having a misogynistic streak - fell apart at the turn of the decade.\nAt the same time, Faithfull lost custody of her son and her life began to spiral out of control.\nA suicide attempt left her in a coma, and she ended up an alcoholic, anorexic heroin addict living in a bomb-damaged building in London's Soho.\nShe looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.\n\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.\n\"It was all too much for me,\" she explained. \"I really didn't like my gilded cage.\"\nOccasional attempts to emerge from her squat in Chelsea failed.\nHer voice - affected by drug abuse and laryngitis - had become permanently rough and lower in pitch.\nBut, a decade after her split with Jagger, Faithfull made Broken English - her most critically acclaimed album.\nGone was the innocence of the 1960s - and in its place, a post-punk performer of depth and world-weary experience.\nThe album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.\nIt was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.\nThe album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.\nBut it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.\nShe moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.\nStill suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.\nBut she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.\nShe also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.\nConstantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.\nNow in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.\nIn the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.\nShe was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.\nBut she never quite lost the creative spark.\nIn recent years, she published a record that put the words of Keats and Wordsworth to music.\nAnd Negative Capability, her 21st album, was described by the Guardian as a \"masterly mediation on ageing and death\".\nIt was notable for They Come at Night, her furious response to the Bataclan terror in Paris.\n\"They come at night,\" she sang, \"and the world goes blind with fear. Terror in Paris, the future is here.\"\nIt also dealt with Faithfull's own increasing frailty and loneliness, as well as the loss of close friends, including fellow Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg.\n\"I know I'm not young and I'm damaged,\" she wrote defiantly. \"But I'm still pretty kind of funny.\"\nMarianne Faithfull will in part be remembered for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend and surviving the horrors of drink and drug addiction.\nBut her resurrection proved - if proof were needed - a rock star's muse can become a fully fledged, respected artist in her own right.\nThe pair have been married for 10 years and have two children, who she says will remain \"their priority\".\nSee the list of nominees for the 67th Grammy Awards, which will take place in February 2025.\nDennis Stone, who has died aged 92, snapped some of the world's most famous people in a long career.\nRedlands is named after the West Wittering house where Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were arrested.\nThe screening will be held at the Midlands Art Centre in Birmingham on Saturday.",

    "text": "Two men aged in their 30s and 50s have been arrested on suspicion of a number of offences following armed robberies in the Mid Ulster area.\nPolice say staff were threatened by masked men and ordered to hand over a sum of money.\nThe robberies happened in three separate locations in the Ballyronan, Coagh and Clonoe areas.\nDetectives conducted a number of searches at properties in the Churchill Park area of Portadown on Thursday evening.\nPolice said the vehicle used by the robbers, a blue Audi A6, was stolen early on Thursday morning from outside an address in Portadown.\nIt was found on fire at about 08:40 at Drumcree Community Centre in the town.\nPolice said the staff had suffered no serious injuries but were \"shocked by the ordeal they experienced\".\nSinn Féin assembly member Linda Dillon condemned the incidents and said staff in Clonoe were left incredibly frightened .\n\"It was a very, very frightening experience for the staff, they really are traumatised.  I'm just glad that nobody was seriously hurt,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"These were people were coming in early to do a day's work and they didn't deserve this.\n\"This shop really is the beating heart of this community in Clonoe and a lot of the staff are from the locality.\n\"Armed robbery is a very serious offence and I sincerely hope the people that carried out this attack are caught, because these are dangerous people. \"\nDillon appealed for anybody with information about the robberies to come forward.\nGlyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI also urged anyone with information about the  \"utterly disgraceful\" robberies to speak to police.\n\"We shouldn't forget these are independent retailers that go above and beyond to serve their local community.\n\"Our thoughts are with the staff who have traumatised by these despicable attacks,\" he said.\nMr Roberts said assaults on staff, shoplifting and robberies are at \"record levels.\n\"It is crucially important that the Department of Justice include the assault of shop staff is specified in the forthcoming Sentencing Bill,\" he said.",

He denies 11 counts of rape as well as three counts of voyeurism, 12 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and eight of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply.\nMr Zou, from Elephant and Castle in south London, studied for a master's degree at University College London from 2019 through to 2021 before beginning a PhD at the same university.\nWarning: The following story contains descriptions which may be distressing\nIn the first clip shown in court, the defendant can be seen positioning the camera to point at a naked woman who is lying motionless on a bed in a room where a blind is drawn. Mr Zou, whose defence is that the encounter was consensual, then goes on to have sex with her.\nFemale A told him to stop, the court heard.\nIn the second clip, which took place in what prosecutors said was the same room, the defendant was again seen having sex with Female A while she told him to stop, the court heard.\nIt is not known when the clips were filmed or who Female A is.\nGiving evidence, Det Con Jack Woods told jurors: \"There appears to be multiple scratches on (Mr Zou's) back on both sides.\"\nDet Con Woods said the clips appeared to have been filmed at Woburn Place near Russell Square in central London, where Mr Zou was living from September 2019 to September 2020.\nJurors were given breaks after the short clips were played, and more videos will be shown to them later on Thursday.\nThe trial continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "text": "Dinosaurs evolved over millions of years\nWhether your favourite is the ferocious looking T-rex, the leaf munching Diplodocus or the horned Triceratops, dinosaurs are an important part of Earth's history.\nBut when and and where they first appeared remains a bit of a puzzle.\nNow a new study has suggested a 'surprising' location for the birthplace of dinosaurs, by looking at their oldest-known fossils, how early dinosaurs evolved and what Earth looked like during theTriassic Period.\nTheir answer for the birthplace are the Sahara desert and the Amazon rainforest regions - which are now separated by thousands of miles, and an ocean, but weren't always.\nThe oldest ichthyosaur fossil ever has been discovered\nMystery of how flying reptiles took to the skies finally solved\n'Oldest EVER' dinosaur fossil found in Brazil\nThe study says we now know more about the birthplace of the dinosaurs\nThe answer to this is thanks to a geological process calledplate tectonics.\nThe Earth's surface is made up of different pieces called tectonic plates. The movement of these plates can change landscapes.\nJoel Heath from University College London is lead author of the study published in the journal Current Biology.\nHe explained that when dinosaursfirst appeared all the Earth's continents were part of the giant supercontinent Pangaea.\nThey emerged in the southern part, known as Gondwana.\nJoel said: \"Our research suggests they likely originated in the low-latitude regions of Gondwana near the equator, an area that today includes northern South America and northern Africa.\"\nEodromaeus lived in the Late Triassic period\nThese regions are difficult for palaeontologists to study, as they are covered in forests and deserts, but Joel says they \"may hold the potential to reveal where the earliest dinosaurs were living.\"\nJoel says this could show \"significant gaps\" in the fossil record.\nWhile the earliest-known dinosaurs share certain traits, they have differences that suggest millions of years of evolution had already taken place.\nThis Nyasasaurus shows what the earliest dinosaurs may have looked like\nDinosaurs evolved from more primitive reptiles in the aftermath of Earth's biggest mass-extinction event. This was caused by extreme explosive eruptions around 252 million years ago.\nAt first they were overshadowed by other animals, like the ancestors of crocodiles and elephants.\nHowever, dinosaurs had some advantages, like being fast, agile and adaptable to different environments.\nThey are unique because of certain traits in their skeletons, like the fact they stood upright with special hips.\nThey evolved gradually over millions of years, but the fossils to show this haven't been found yet, Joel says.\nThen, around 200 million years ago, a huge extinction event wiped out many of their competitors, which was when it truly became the land of the dinosaurs.\nIsle of Wight dino is 'most complete' in more than 100 years\nDid a crocodile bite a pterosaur 76 million years ago?\nBiggest ever UK dinosaur footprint site discovered\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "Priti Patel has put out a statement insisting she \"was not happy\" about the levels of immigration under the previous Conservative government, after earlier defending her party's record.\nIn the earlier interview, Patel also declined to apologise for a rise in the numbers coming to the UK which took place when she was home secretary.\nSpeaking to The Sun's Never Mind The Ballots, Patel, now shadow foreign secretary, said it was \"totally distortionary\" to suggest the government in which she served had thrown open the UK's borders.\nHer party leader Kemi Badenoch appeared to distance herself from the remarks, with her spokesman saying the Conservatives would \"tell the truth about the mistakes we made\".\n\"While the last Conservative government may have tried to control numbers, we did not deliver,\" he added.\nLast year, shortly after becoming leader, Badenoch held a press conference in which she said the rise in immigration had been \"a collective failure of political leaders from all parties over decades... but on behalf of the Conservative party, as the new leader, it is right that I accept responsibility and say truthfully, we got this wrong.\"\nFigures released in 2024 showed net migration to the UK hit a record 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before falling to 728,000 the following year.\nImmigration rose sharply under the points-based system for work visas, introduced after Brexit.\nChallenged on the figures in an interview on Thursday, Patel - who was home secretary between 2019 and 2022 - sought to defend the Conservative's record on immigration.\nShe said the points-based system had allowed the government to control the flow of immigration based on \"what our economy needs and what it doesn't need\".\nAsked if she should apologise to voters who were told Brexit would lead to a reduction in immigration, Patel said: \"I did not mislead them\".\n\"We made it quite clear it would be people from the rest of the world, people with skills\" coming into the UK post-Brexit, she added.\nShe said many people came to the UK on health and social care visas, adding: \"Are we now saying we don't need those people in our NHS?\"\nHowever, she also said she was \"not fine\" with big rises in immigration and argued that the previous government should have done more to train people in the UK instead of relying on foreign labour to fill gaps in sectors such as farming.\nAsked why that had not happened, she said: \"That's a very good question that should have been posed to [environment ministers] and to others.\n\"I was doing other national security issues - the job of the home secretary.\"\nResponding to the interview, Labour labelled the Conservatives \"out of touch\" and said Patel \"seems proud of her central role in the Tory open-border experiment\".\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the Conservatives had a \"disastrous record on immigration - and would do it again\".\nA few hours after the interview was broadcast, Patel posted a message on social media in which she said: \"The immigration system in our country is not fit for purpose.\n\"As I said in the interview, I was not happy about the high numbers while the Conservatives were in government.\n\"Our party is now under new leadership and it is important we learn from our mistakes and how we can do things better.\"\nThe Tory leader accuses PM of \"vandalism\" but Sir Keir says the Schools Bill will protect vulnerable children.\nThe Tory leader said her party wanted to look at greater means-testing of government support.\nSir Ed also called for Donald Trump to be offered a state visit to the UK, but only if he delivered support for Ukraine.\nIn her first major speech of 2025, Badenoch acknowledges the Conservatives \"made mistakes\".\nThe exchange follows Tulip Siddiq's resignation over an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh.",

    "text": "Finn Russell says his young family has helped him relax off-field\nSix Nations: Scotland v Italy\nVenue:Murrayfield Stadium, EdinburghDate:Saturday, 1 FebruaryTime:14:15 GMT\nCoverage:Watch live on BBC One, listen on Radio 5 live, Radio Scotland & BBC Sounds and follow live on the BBC Sport website and app.\nFinn Russell is one of rugby union's biggest stars. A normal lad from Stirling done good who is unashamedly himself on and off the field.\nHis journey to the top is well documented. He worked as a stonemason while playing club rugby for Falkirk before signing for Glasgow Warriors and subsequently making his Scotland debut in 2014 at the age of 21.\nThe Bath fly-half controls games like few others while also possessing the ability and vision to unlock defences in the blink of an eye.\nAudacious offloads, cross-field kicks and cheeky nutmegs from the now 32-year-old dominate YouTube compilations, but he is more than just a flashy maverick.\nWith age has come maturity and a sense of when to be pragmatic, but Russell has never lost his love for the game.\n\"When I first came through, a lot of it was about being very serious in the pitch and and not joking around, not laughing,\" Scotland's co-captain told 5 Live Breakfast.\nWhat's life like in the Scotland Six Nations camp?\nBig names 'need to really shine' for injury-hit Scotland\nHow to follow 2025 Six Nations across the BBC\n\"I came on with a smile and that was looked at as 'he doesn't care, he's a joker, he's not taking this seriously', which is not the case.\n\"I'm on there having fun and doing my job, so why can't I do it with a smile on my face?\n\"I think it is starting to change a little bit - you'll see more and more players being themselves on the pitch and off the field as well.\"\nMuch has been made of Russell's perceived lack of success given his obvious talent - his last title was the 2015 Pro12 with Glasgow.\nBut the man himself believes his fortunes will turn after losing the Champions Cup final with Racing 92 in 2020 and the Premiership final with Bath last year.\n\"It's probably been in the last year that people have started asking that sort of question, maybe because I'm getting a little bit older,\" Russell said.\n\"It's tough not winning titles but getting so close, but I don't think you ever lose that drive. It's always going to be there, I've not given up on it yet.\n\"Yeah, it does increase, but you still need the enjoyment. If I'm playing and happy and enjoying it then hopefully the rest kind of comes into place.\"\nBristol Bears and United States player Ilona Maher - who has a huge following on TikTok through her appearance on Dancing with the Stars - has spoken out about how rugby needs to expose its bigger personalities more if it is to attract new fans.\nThis time last year, Netflix released an eight-part documentary series taking fans behind the scenes of the 2023 Six Nations in the hope of doing just that.\nFull Contact focused on certain players - Russell, Wales' Louis Rees-Zammit, England's Owen Farrell and Ellis Genge, and Ireland's Johnny Sexton and Andrew Porter - but as with many documentary of that type, it only told part of the story.\nRussell is disappointed at the news there will not be a third series, seeing the benefits of such a show despite its limited access.\n\"The Netflix series I think helps show that other side of rugby and the players,\" he said. \"It's good for the sport to grow.\n\"I'm not sure how much access they got behind the scenes and how much they were allowed to do through the different unions.\n\"I'm pretty relaxed about most things, so I'm like 'well, why not just let them see everything'. I think that was good for this sport, so it's a shame that they're not doing another one.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDrama, despair & smelly socks - pundits relive Six Nations days\nRussell's outlook on rugby has changed in the past two years.\nAt the start of his career, he would replay games in his head, especially losses, fixating on what he could have done differently.\nSince becoming a father to seven-month-old Skye and two-year-old Charlie, though, Russell finds it easier to switch off from his work.\n\"My eldest daughter, Charlie, was two in November - she's good fun, chatty,\" he said.\n\"It's cool being here in Bath, a smaller city - you can go into town and she can run around and have fun and chat to people.\n\"After a game whether you win or lose, I'll see Charlie and it kind of makes you forget about the game and what's happened. It definitely takes your mind off it.\n\"It definitely does give you a different perspective on life and on rugby instead of being down after the game, rethinking what could have been different.\n\"I wouldn't say it's recovery because you're full on with the kids, but in terms of getting away from rugby, it's really good.\n\"Instead of PlayStation, I've got my two-year-old to keep me busy.\"\nAll the latest Scottish rugby news as Six Nations looms",

    "text": "Ukrainians can again bring their children to join them in the UK, after the government reversed changes to visa rules.\nLast February - without notice - the government restricted eligibility so Ukrainians without the right to live in the UK permanently could no longer sponsor people under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people to host those fleeing the war.\nCharities said this left families torn apart, with some desperate parents resorting to illegal routes to bring their children to the UK.\nThey welcomed the announcement as a \"huge relief\" for parents separated from their children but warned it will not help those forced apart from other family members such as siblings or parents.\nMore than 190,000 people have come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since it was launched in March 2022, following the Russian invasion.\nHowever, under changes brought in last February under the Conservatives,only British or Irish citizens, or those with the right to live in the UK permanently, have been able to act as sponsors, who provide somewhere for people to live.\nThis meant Ukrainians living in the UK without permanent residence could no longer sponsor family members to join them in the UK.\nAt the same time the Ukraine Family Scheme, which allowed Ukrainians to join family members who already had permanent residence in the UK, was also closed.\nThe government has now announceda parent or legal guardian who is in the UK under any of the visa schemes for Ukrainians can apply to sponsor their child under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\nValentyna - not her real name - applied for her 12-year-old son to join her in the UK last August but her application had remained pending because Ukrainians were no longer allowed to act as sponsors.\nShe first came to the UK before the invasion for seasonal work on a farm and extended her visa when the war broke out.\nHer son was staying with relatives in Odessa while she found somewhere permanent to live before applying for him to join her.\nValentyna has not seen her son for six months and became emotional when asked how it felt to be separated from him.\nShe told the BBC the change in the rules gave her hope they would finally be reunited.\nDora-Olivia Vicol, chief executive of Work Rights Centre, a charity supporting migrants, said: \"It will come as a huge relief to those parents who have been separated from their children, and will finally be able to bring them to the UK to reunite in safety.\"\nShe added: \"However, this action does not help those who have been forced apart from other family members, including siblings, parents or partners.\n\"We know there are many Ukrainians in the UK who left behind elderly, sick or disabled relatives with the belief they would be able to bring them later. They face a cruel choice: leave the safety of the UK to care for them in Ukraine, or remain in safety leaving their loved ones vulnerable at risk.\"\nThe charity says it has heard from hundreds of Ukrainians separated from family members and trying to bring them to the UK.\nSettled, another charity which supports Ukrainians applying for visas, said some families had resorted to bringing their children to join them through illegal routes, rather than leave them in danger.\nYuliia Ismail, an immigration advisor for the charity, said: \"We ask that the Home Office now acts quickly to decide outstanding applications from children stuck in Ukrainian conflict zones some of which have been in limbo for almost a year.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Under the previous government, a change was made to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which meant that parents could not sponsor their children to join them in the UK even if they had appropriate accommodation.\n\"We have taken urgent action to resolve this issue, which will now enable parents with Ukraine Scheme visas to sponsor their children to join them in the UK. These will apply to both applications that have already been made, as well as future applications.\"\nThe vessel was towed out of Portland Port in Dorset by tugboats on Thursday afternoon.\nThe UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.\nThe Asylum seeker barge, Bibby Stockholm, has been pictured leaving Portland 18 months after it arrived.\nBorder officials will also get powers to seize migrants' phones, under new laws unveiled by the Home Office.\nThe number of people crossing the Channel in small boats has led the government to promise action.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Pop star Rihanna was in a Los Angeles courtroom on Wednesday as her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, continued his trial on assault charges.\nThe singer, who shares two children with the rapper, sat in the court with A$AP Rocky's family as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.\nThetrial started on Fridayand will determine whether the rapper will face penalties on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.\nA$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.\nHere's what you need to know about the case.\nA$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.\nThe rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in Hollywood.\nAuthorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.\nThe victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors\nThey were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.\nTheir relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.\nIt all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.\nMr Ephron took the stand this week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.\nAuthorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.\nThey met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nProsecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is then alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".\nCourt documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.\nMr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.\nThat's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.\nCourt documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.\nAuthorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.\nSome of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.\nThere are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.\nThe rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.\nHis lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.\nCourt documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.\nHe also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.\nYes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.\nA panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.\nIt's unclear ifRihannawill continue appearing for the trial. Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court this week that Mr Mayers has tried to keep his family away from all of this.\nMedia reports indicate that on Wednesday she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom. Thecouple's two childrendid not appear.\nRihanna's presence sparked intense media and fan interest outside the courthouse, but she entered through a non-public entrance used by judges, and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.\nDuring jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.\nRihanna's presence did attract attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.\nRocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna sat out of view of the cameras in the courtroom.\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of targeted responses.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nProsecutors file an amended list of charges against the star, saying he coerced more women into sex.",

    "text": "Nottinghamshire County Council is set to increase its share of council tax bills by 4.84% from April, it has been announced.\nTheConservative-run authoritysaid it would increase the average bill for all households across the county by £1.43 a week.\nBudget documents state the council continues to face a \"challenging financial environment\" due to inflation and increasing demand for services.\nCabinet member for finance, Richard Jackson, said the authority had tried to balance \"services people rely on with the affordability of council tax\".\n\"We've taken a view we don't want to tax the maximum we're allowed to. The government is really expecting councils like us to tax an increase of 5%, we've managed to keep below that,\" Jackson said.\n\"Crucially we've done that whilst maintaining our services.\"\nThe council said it had also been \"adversely affected\" by the increase in national insurance contributions for employers and a rise in the National Living Wage,announced at the Budget in October.\nThe council's budget report, published on Wednesday, forecasts a cumulative funding gap of £21.8m over the next four financial years.\nThe position has improved since October, however, at which point it predicted a£76m shortfall over three years.\nJackson said managing the deficit would be a \"challenge\" but he was confident the gap could be closed by improving efficiency rather than cutting services.\nLeader of the Ashfield Independents, Jason Zadrozny, said he was \"really disappointed\" at the tax rise.\n\"It's no surprise, because Labour before them and the Conservatives now have always done things the easiest possible way,\" he said.\n\"For them that is dipping their hands in the pockets of residents across Nottinghamshire.\"\nLabour group leader Kate Foale raised concerns over the projected budget gap.\n\"Even as they raise council tax on local residents, the Tories still come up millions of pounds short after a decade of chronic underfunding of councils by the Conservative government,\" she said.\nThe tax rise is made up of a 2.84% basic increase and a further 2% to pay for adult social care.\nIt will be discussed at a meeting of the authority's cabinet next week before being submitted to full council for approval.\nNeighbouring Nottingham City Councilannounced plans to raise tax by 4.99% on Tuesday.\nFollow BBC Nottingham onFacebook, onX, or onInstagram.

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Water bills in England and Wales will rise by an average of £123 a year from April.\nThe average annual bill will be £603, but there are significant differences between water companies. Households cannot choose their supplier.\nThe average bill increase is around £10 a month - from £40 to £50 - but millions of households face even steeper rises.\nSouthern Water customers will see a 47% increase to £703 a year while Hafren Dyfrdwy and South West Water bills are rising by 32%.\nThames Water customers have been warned they will see a 31% hike and Yorkshire Water is raising bills by 29%.\nBournemouth Water customers will see a 32% increase to their bills.\nFirms say they need extra money to replace ageing, leaking pipes and to reduce sewage discharges into rivers and seas.\nHowever, companies are also facing increasing scrutiny and public anger over their environmental and financial performance, as well as executive bonuses and pay.\nThere has been a lot of disagreement about price rises between companies and the water regulator Ofwat.\nIn December, Ofwat said companies couldraise bills by an average of £31 a year over the next five years, with those increases to be front-loaded.\nThat means customers will face the biggest rise in the first year of the period, and smaller increases in the subsequent four years.\nWater companies say that will start in April with a £123 average rise on an annual bill - partly to take account of inflation, which was not included in Ofwat's December calculation.\nSome households in England and Wales have a water meter, so only pay for the amount they use, plus a standing charge.\nUnmetered customers pay a set amount regardless of how much water they use. This is usually based on the rateable value of their home - an approximate annual rental value for the property.\nAll households also pay for sewerage services, either as part of their water bill or separately if their water company doesn’t deliver wastewater services.\nThere are a number of ways to try to reduce your water bill:\nUse less water:Many water companies offer customers free water-saving devices. Take showers instead of baths and use a timer. Only run washing machines and dishwashers with full loads. Don't overfill your kettle. If you water your garden, install a water butt to capture rainwater.\nCheck your bill:Look out for any unexplained increases - you may have a leak.\nGet a water meter:Meters can reduce bills for some. Every household can apply to have one installed. If a meter is not suitable, your water company must offer something called an “assessed charge” which may also save you money.\nMove to a social tariff:Every water company offers a scheme which can help reduce your bills if you’re on a low income but the each firm's rules are different.\nSewage service rebates:Households may be able to get a rebate for certain sewage services if they can prove they do not use them.\nWater companies say they will also set aside more than £4bn to fund social tariffs - the discounted bills for vulnerable people - over the next five years.\nBut the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), which represents billpayers, said support did not go far enough, as about 2.5 million households were already in debt to their water company.\nThe amount of financial support available to those struggling and the qualifying criteria vary by company.\nThe CCW wants all firms to have a single scheme so that everyone gets the same help wherever they live.\nAs part of its price review, Ofwat sets performance targets to encourage water companies to meet their commitments to customers and the environment.\nThey are expected to reduce leakage, pollution incidents and sewer flooding.\nIf a company beats its targets it may get a financial reward. If it does not meet them, it may face a penalty.\nThe companies reflect these costs in annual adjustments to customer bills.\nIn 2024-25 water companies will have torepay £114m.\nA small number of Scottish households have water meters.\nHowever, most pay for water and sewerage services as part of their council tax, with the amount linked to their property's council tax band.\nAverage billswill rise by £35.95 in 2024/25, according to Scottish Water.\nSomeone living in a council tax band C propertywill pay on average £485.68 for water and sewerage services.\nHouseholds in Northern Ireland arenot billed for water.\nPolice say the man was shot at his home in the Ballygallin Park area of Coleraine on Thursday evening.\nThe 3.8% increase means an anytime return ticket between Glasgow and Edinburgh will rise by £1.20.\nPolice say the family of Henrietta Huszti has been informed and the search for her sister Eliza continues.\nAt its peak 30% of all premises in Northern Ireland had their power disconnected.\nThe education minister says a resolution is \"close\" but a union says negotiations are continuing.",

I am not sure my body can handle it.\n\"I would rather step away now, while I am still at my peak, to focus on my health and enjoy life with my family. I am super excited to be more present for my loved ones, especially my partner who has spent almost five years raising our family like a single mum while also being a manager for my career.

Thankfully my medication helps a lot, though it will weaken my immune system.\n\"Although the team doctors and Lillehammer hospital have given me excellent support and are optimistic I could continue competing as normal, there are uncertainties about whether my health will hold up.\n\"I would rather step away now, while I am still at my peak, to focus on my health and enjoy life with my family.\"",

    "text": "A groundworks firm has been fined £50,000 over safety failings that led to two workers being crushed to death by the collapsing wall of a former milking byre near Linlithgow.\nPeter Walker, 53, and James Henderson, 48, were killed instantly when a freestanding sandstone wall collapsed on top of them at Myrehead Farm on6 May 2019.\nFernbrooke Scotland had been brought in to underpin the wall by installing steel cages filled with stones and concrete at its base.\nSheriff Keith O'Mahony ruled at Stirling Sheriff Court that the work was \"extremely unsafe\" and that there was \"a high likelihood of harm\" at the site.\nThe 9ft 6in (2.9m) high, 63ft (19.2m) long sandstone wall had been left free-standing after the demolition of the centuries-old byre some years earlier.\nMr Walker, 53, from Blackburn, West Lothian, and Mr Henderson, known as Paul, from Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, were using picks and shovels to create a long trench for the cages to sit in when the wall \"suddenly split in the middle horizontally\".\nIt caused 50 tonnes of sandstone blocks, rubble and lime mortarto fall on top of them.\nTwo other men - David McNeil, then 36, and Charles Johnstone, then 21, - were severely injured.\nProsecutor Catherine Fraser told the court that investigations by a Health and Safety Executive inspector found the underpinning had beendone in an unsafe manner, which undermined the wall and contributed to its collapse.\nThere had been no evidence that temporary supports had been used to shore up the wall, and no consulting engineer was supervising the process.\nFernbrooke Scotland LLP, of Blackburn, West Lothian, run by Kevin Dolan, 64, of Avonbridge, near Falkirk, pled guilty to failing to ensure the safety of the men.\nThe company admitted omitting to check the condition of the wall, and in particular its foundations, prior to starting the renovation.\nSheriff O'Mahony said the firm's turnover of under £580,000 a year meant it had to be treated as a \"micro organisation\", restricting the level of fine given.\nHe said it had been \"a tragic event.\"\nMore than a dozen members of the victims' families were present on the public benches, and greeted the sentence in silence.\nThe work was part of a project to convert a former farmsteading for a housing development.\nPeter Gray KC, for Fernbrook, told the court the firm had settled all civil claims relating to the tragedy, and took its responsibilities \"very seriously\".\nHe said the incident was \"a matter of the greatest concern and genuine regret\" and he offered the firm's deepest sympathies to the men's families.\nHe said Fernbrooke have stopped undertaking any similar type of work.\nBurnley MP Oliver Ryan says a commercial route being run from April is a \"brilliant outcome\".\nNeil Jeffrey was heard to shout a racist slur towards Blackburn Rovers striker Makhtar Gueye, police say.\nBlackburn Empire Theatre wants to turn an unused storeroom into a dance studio and rehearsal room.\nMorecambe and parts of Blackburn and Wigan are lacking in life-saving defibrillators, a charity warns.\nDavid Cairney, 36,  fractured one victim's skull and left another victim with a fractured eye socket.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "A photography student is hoping to raise awareness of a debilitating pelvic condition by taking images of herself as she suffers with the disease.\nEmma Bennison, 21, is studying at Falmouth University and has struggled with endometriosis symptoms since she was 14.\nEndometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation that often causes pain in the pelvis and other parts of the body, and can also cause severe fatigue, anxiety and infertility in some cases.\nMs Bennison said the pictures were \"raw\" because it was \"the only way to get the point across\".\n\"If they were soft and dainty it's not going to do they job that they need to do.  They need to show the reality of what it's like living with a disease, that is so common and no-one knows what it is.\"\nShe has taken photographs of herself as she deals with the aftermath of two surgeries, and during a flare-up.\nThey include images showing bruising after an operation and a self-portrait showing her demeanour as she dealt with the agony of the condition.\nIt took eight years before she got a clear diagnosis which only came after paying for a private laparoscopy - a surgical procedure using keyhole surgery, to allow a surgeon to examine and treat the organs inside the abdomen and pelvis.\nShe said: \"Every doctor's appointment was like going into a battlefield... I was passed from pillar to post.  No one had any idea about was going on... it was like someone stabbing me.  It just wouldn't go away. It was horrific.  It didn't matter what I said, no-one would take me seriously.\"\nShe's now had two operations to remove as much of the endometriosis as possible and manages the condition with painkillers and rest.\nRecent figures from the Office of Statistics show about two in 100 women were diagnosed with endometriosis between 2011 and 2021, but because of a long delay in diagnosis the figure is thought to be much higher.\nThe charity, Endometriosis UK, estimates as many as one in 10 women in the UK suffer with the condition.\nOne of Emma's fellow students, Poppy-Fe Howe, 20, also believes she has symptoms of endometriosis but has not been able to get a diagnosis.\n\"It's hard to get listened to at 16 when you are saying you are in all of this pain\", she said.\nShe believes there is a lack of education and understanding from some medics.\n\"Definitely male GPs - I think when a women goes to them and says 'I am in all of this pain - I am having all of these issues with my female reproductive system',  they kind of go 'ahhh, I don't want to talk about this'.\n\"They don't want to talk about it with me, and even with my mum present they are always skirting around the issue.\"\nThe chief executive of Endometriosis UK, Emma Cox, wants clear action from the government to shorten the time it takes to get a diagnosis from the current nine years.\nShe said: \"The first steps are setting a diagnosis target of an average of a year or less so that we are actually diagnosing people and then they can access treatment that they need to manage the disease.\n\"We also need in parallel with that really great training to support healthcare practitioners, so they understand and recognise the symptoms and help people with that.\n\"And also tackle the ridiculously long gynaecological waiting lists so the people who need surgery can access it as they would any other condition.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Too many women are facing unacceptable waits for gynaecology treatment and we know that more needs to be done to support women with endometriosis.\n\"This government is overhauling women's healthcare to get women the support they need, when they need it. We are investing an extra £26 billion in the NHS and through our Plan for Change we will get it back on its feet, including by cutting waiting times from 18 months to a maximum of 18 weeks.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall onX,FacebookandInstagram.

    "text": "Ivor:As courageous and together the team are, they are just not good enough. Every season two teams show they are superior with points far ahead at the top, they also manage to sign excellent strikers, why can't city?\nTerry:Football is a constant revolving door, players come and players go. Done properly, football is a balance between squad improvement and the development of younger players, of course all dependent on a budget. For teams like Cardiff it's always a trade-off, will the next one through the door improve the overall standard.\nStephen:The team are still in a relegation battle due to the very poor start to the season, despite the recent upturn in form. Teams around us are picking up valuable survival points. A few games without any points could easily see us drop back into the bottom three. There have been goals leaked all season by not shutting down the opposition.\nAndy:Omer Riza is doing great, the players are really playing for him, as well as grinding out results. A few more areas could do with bulking.\nMark:Given the injuries to both Aaron Ramsey and David Turnbull, I think extra creativity from midfield is needed. The new Norwegian player is more of a defensive midfielder, so we could do with a 10 or a second striker who plays behind the main striker. We could also do with a winger or an inside forward that can cross the ball, that would be a bonus.\nMichael:It looks as though the search for a decent goal scorer has finally come to an end with the signing of Salech. He looks to be a proven 'poacher' in the old school sense of the word. The midfield is solid, you've got Robinson chipping in with goals and Joe Ralls providing some grit and steel. However, defensively I think the team might need another good defender.\nDoushki:Desperately need additions at right and left back, Perry Ng's form has been shocking this season and Joel Bagan needs competition. Andy Rinomhota has been a good backup for Ng, but we need better. I'd also like a new keeper as Alnwick's distribution is shocking and Horvath is awful. A new speedster out wide is also required to give us more options going forward.\nJonathan:I've been impressed with a couple of the signings so far, but we still need a decent pacey winger, a creative midfielder and a solid left back before the window shuts. We're still in a relegation fight and the fixtures over the next month will determine whether we are still in that fight come March and April.",

    "text": "A man accused of murdering his son's girlfriend was suffering from a \"delusional disorder\" at the time of the killing, a court has heard.\nThe body of Sophie Evans was found at a property in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, on 5 July 2024.\nRichard Jones believed he was being \"scammed\" by Ms Evans and his son, Jamie Davies, who she was in a relationship with - but the court heard there \"was not a shred of evidence\" this was true.\nMr Jones, 55, from Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, has admitted manslaughter with diminished responsibility but denies her murder.\nThe court heard Mr Jones believed he was being \"scammed\" by Ms Evans and Mr Davies, after they \"tricked\" him into signing over the deeds to his mother's house.\nDavid Elias KC, for the defence, told the jury these were \"falsely held beliefs\" caused by a delusional disorder.\nMr Elias reminded the jury of evidence given by consultant psychiatrist, Dr Dilum Jayawickrama, who interviewed Mr Jones after the incident in August 2024.\nDr Jayawickrama said Mr Jones was \"100% certain in his beliefs\" he had been scammed.\nThe court heard that Mr Jones told officers he had been taken to a solicitor's office by Ms Evans to sign forms, leading him to believe he had signed over the deeds to his mother's house.\n\"There is not a single shred of evidence to say that was true,\" Mr Elias told the jury.\nHe told the court evidence from the staff member who dealt with Ms Evans and Mr Jones at the solicitor's office said the \"meeting lasted between five and 10 minutes and Richard remained silent throughout\".\nThey added that \"Richard did not sign any documents\".\nMr Elias told the jury this belief held by Mr Jones led to \"significant emotional distress\", and Dr Jayawickrama's opinion was at the time of the killing, \"there was abnormality of mental functioning because of significant emotional distress\", which arose from a \"delusional disorder\".\nDr Jayawickrama concluded there was \"substantial impairment in his ability to form a rational judgement because of the significant emotional distress\".\nDuring the prosecution's closing speeches, Mike Jones KC told the jury around the time Ms Evans was killed, Mr Jones \"was not experiencing significant emotional distress\" but \"callous indifference\" to what he did to her.\nMr Jones KC told the jury that the defendant had \"by his own admission, a historic short fuse\", and on the day of the incident \"had lost his temper, attacked Sophie and strangled her, causing her death\".\nHe reminded the jury of CCTV footage shown to the court, where Mr Jones is seen \"calmly walking from the house\" where Ms Evans was killed.\nHe told the jury to \"consider this\", when it is the defence's view he was experiencing \"significant emotional distress\".\nMr Jones did not give evidence during the trial, which defence barrister David Elias KC said, \"is the defendant's right\", and Mr Jones is aware of the \"potential consequences\".\nMr Elias told the court Mr Jones had given his version of events in police and psychiatric interviews.\nThe trial continues.\nMother-of-two Sophie Evans had just returned home from the school drop-off when she was murdered.\nRichard Jones believed his son and Sophie Evans had \"tricked\" him out of the deeds to a house.\nStroke victims are concerned changes could see them having to travel for hours to another unit.\nSophie Evans’s family has said they are “heartbroken by her loss” and that she will be missed.\nThe judge says the 64-year-old's murder was \"senseless and cruel\" and the killer showed no remorse.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "A double murderer who carried out the \"bloodthirsty\" killing of a woman and dumped her dismembered body has been jailed for the rest of his life.\nBuilder Steve Sansom was out of prison on life licence when he killed Sarah Mayhew, 38, and disposed of her remains in different locations around London, the Old Bailey heard.\nThe 45-year-old, who murdered a taxi driver in 1998, and his partner Gemma Watts both admitted murder and also perverting the course of justice by dismembering Ms Mayhew's body.\nMrs Justice Cutts sentenced Samson to a whole-life order, which means he will never be released from prison. Watts, 49, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 30 years.\nSentencing the pair, Mrs Justice Cutts said Ms Mayhew's \"greatest misfortune was to know the two of you\".\nWarning: The following story contains distressing details\nMs Mayhew had two children, who were aged 12 and 15 when she was killed.\nShe hadmet Sansom, from Sutton, on a dating website a few years before.\nThe judge said she was \"quite certain\" that graphic messages of sexual violence between Sansom and Watts moved from fantasy to a plan to involve a third party, whom they planned to murder.\nWhen Sansom contacted Ms Mayhew \"he had murder in mind\" and she had been taken to his flat for \"depraved and violent sexual activity\", the court heard.\n\"Her fear and suffering must have been acute as she realised why she was there and what was happening,\" Mrs Justice Cutts added.\n\"She was an innocent woman lured to that flat to die,\" she said, so the pair could act out their \"bloodthirsty and wicked fantasy\".\nThe court heard Sansom had never shown remorse for what he had done.\nThe judge said she was in no doubt his offending was exceptionally high and that it required a whole-life order.\nWatts was \"obsessed\" with Sansom, but it was not a case of \"one person's will being overborne by another\", the judge said.\nPrior to sentencing, in a statement read to the court, Ms Mayhew's father, David Mayhew, said: \"I ask myself the same question all the time: 'Why did you have to kill her?' Maybe I will never know.\"\nHe thanked the killers for pleading guilty to murder and sparing the family the ordeal of having to go through a trial.\n\"That said, whatever sentence you receive will never compare to the pain you have caused us,\" he said.\nMs Mayhew's mother, Angela, said she missed her \"beautiful, pretty girl\".\n\"It breaks my heart she is not around, I miss Sarah all the time,\" she said.\nShe added that her daughter was a \"popular girl with lots of friends from when she was little\" and that she was \"really clever at school\".\nBefore the murder, the killers exchanged \"depraved\" messages detailing a desire to kill people with a knife or knives while engaged in sexual activity.\nProsecutor Tom Little KC previously told court it was a killing that involved sexual and \"sadistic\" conduct.\nMs Mayhew had accompanied Sansom to his flat in Burnell Road, Sutton, at about 23:00 GMT on 8 March 2024.\n\"From that point in time she was never seen again and she never left that property alive,\" said Mr Little.\n\"How long she lived for only the defendants know and they have never said.\n\"What precisely happened to her body after she had been murdered by them in the property only the defendants know.\"\nMs Mayhew's head and limbs were found more than eight miles (nearly 13km) away in Rowdown Field in New Addington on 2 April, the court heard.\nHer torso was discovered later in the River Wandle.\nShe had been living at Friars Wood in Croydon at the time of her death and knew both Sansom and Watts, who was also from Croydon, Mr Little said.\nMessages between the killers indicated that Ms Mayhew introduced them to each other in the summer of 2023.\nBy the time of the murder, Sansom and Watts had been in a sexual relationship for seven months.\n\"Messages indicate that from the early stages their relationship was characterised by sado-masochistic violence,\" said Mr Little.\n\"Such was the intensity of the defendants' relationship at this early stage that they referred to dying together if they were ever caught.\"\nHe added that \"given the messages sent between the defendants\" it was not possible to conclude Ms Mayhew was killed immediately.\nAfter the murder, Sansom said: \"We're not evil, we're not evil. We done the world a service.\"\nThe court heard Sansom hadmurdered before- having served nearly 20 years in prison for stabbing a minicab driver on Christmas Eve in 1998 and stealing his wallet. He was released on licence in 2019.\nCharlotte Newell KC said in mitigation that Watts had a history of mental health crises and had been \"manipulated\" by Sansom.\nBoth defendants were given concurrent sentences of five years for perverting the course of justice.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "It begins with a phone call with a location.\nOnce the details are received, a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) sets off in vehicles marked with the humanitarian organisation's logo to pick up the hostages in Gaza.\nIsraeli military and medical personnel are also assembled at several different locations, waiting to bring them home.\n​​The hostage releases, watched around the world, come after months of tense negotiations aimed at ending a war that began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters killed some 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 251 others.\nIn the 15 months that followed, more than 47,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and many more lost their homes in Israeli bombardments.\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that began on 19 January, a total of 33 Israeli hostages are due to be released and returned to their families during the first phase, lasting six weeks.\nIn exchange, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are being freed.\nIf anything goes wrong, it risks the hostages remaining in captivity, and reigniting the war.\n\"This is more than just a drive,\" says ICRC spokesperson Sarah Davies.\n\"These operations may seem simple, but in fact they are very complex and require rigorous security measures to minimise the risks to those involved.\"\nThe ICRC, which acts as a neutral intermediary in the handover, assembles a team of specialists, some of whom have been involved in similar operations in the past - though this is more challenging than most.\nThere are some details that the group cannot speak about publicly because of concerns that it could compromise the security of the operation.\nMs Davies says planning is crucial to ensuring that the exchange runs smoothly. They have mapped out alternative routes to get to different locations in Gaza, knowing that the \"safest route can change\" at any time.\nAmong their biggest concerns are the dangers posed by unexploded ordnance, destroyed and damaged infrastructure, and large crowds with \"heightened emotions\".\n\"Our teams prepare and plan for as many scenarios as possible,\" she says.\n\"The most important thing for us is to be able to return any person entrusted to our care safely back to their homes.\"\nBut it is impossible to plan for everything.\n\"From previous experience, here and in other places around the world, we know that the logistics and final details can change at any time, even – and particularly – during operations themselves,\" says Ms Davies.\nMedical staff and so-called weapons contamination specialists, trained in identifying explosive remnants of war, travel with the teams.\nDuring the operations, ICRC representatives also maintain regular contact with both Israeli officials and Hamas, as well as mediators.\nIn the previous releases, Hamas has circulated the names of the released hostages in advance on its Telegram channels, without revealing exactly where the handovers will happen.\nThe first public signs of the locations have been the presence of armed and masked members of Hamas's military wing.\n\"I found out from a kiosk guy that there was something happening at the junction and that al-Qassam fighters were having a parade,\" a local journalist says of the first release in Gaza City earlier this month.\nCrowds started gathering to watch as the fighters assembled in formation, and word began to spread thatthe first three hostages releasedunder the ceasefire deal would appear there.\n\"When people realised this would be the place where they would hand over the Israeli hostages, people started chanting [for al-Qassam and senior Hamas figures],\" he says. \"They started shouting 'God is greatest' - that showed how joyful they were.\"\nThe journalist was also there forthe second release- at a different location in Gaza City - the following week, which he describes as being \"more organised\".\nThe fighters set up a small stage area with a desk and chairs, and stood in formation to separate the hostages from the crowds.\nWhite cars with blacked out windows were used to bring the hostages - four women soldiers - to the area.\nThe young women were filmed thanking their captors and being handed gift bags in a video published by Hamas' military wing.\nThey were brought on to the stage and waved at the cheering crowd, before being handed over to the care of the ICRC.\nHamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou said in a later statement that the \"scenes and details\" of the staged handover \"tell the story of resistance creativity, heroism, and reinforce a model of pride and dignity\".\nMs Davies says there are some aspects of the handover that are \"out of our control\".\n\"At all times, ICRC staff do their utmost to protect the dignity of those being released, but… it is important that people recognise the limitations of what we can do,\" she says.\n\"Our priority remains the safe and successful release and transfer of those in our care.\"\nThe hostages are transferred to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on the outskirts of Gaza.\nCol Dr Avi Banov, deputy chief of the Israel Defense Forces medical corps, says: \"We're prepared through the outskirts of Gaza and other areas to receive the hostages.\n\"We always prepare because Hamas does not tell us, 'OK, we're going to free them in this area or in that area'.\"\nAcross the border, reception points have been set up to receive them.\nOn site are military and medical personnel, social workers and the hostages' families.\nA former Israeli army medic who was involved in the first hostage return operation during the November 2023 ceasefire remembers waiting next to an ambulance at a base near the border. His was one of several teams on standby in case one of the hostages had a medical emergency and says there were strict instructions about how to interact with those who returned.\nHe recalls: \"We were told if you evacuate them, don't ask them questions, don't do anything inappropriate, just be quiet and then if the hostages asks you something or want something, of course you're going to answer and give it to them. But be low key.\"\nHe says the atmosphere at the base was one of excitement and nerves. \"It was a very important mission,\" he says.\nCol Dr Banov says the return begins with an introduction between the hostages and medical staff.\nThe returned hostages are assigned a physician, a nurse and a social worker who \"accompany them all the way through\" to them being taken to hospital.\nFamilies are advised to give the hostages \"a little bit of time\" with the medical teams before the reunion to allow them to \"breathe and understand that [they're] in a safe place again\".\n\"We start with vitamins, something small to eat and drink, and then the families,\" Col Dr Banov says.\nAs part of a \"grounding\" process, he says, efforts are made to give the released hostages agency to make their own decisions, with questions like: \"Would you like to take a shower before or after you meet your parents?\"\nOf the first seven hostages to be released, he says most had \"some sort of shrapnel injuries\" as well as suffering from malnutrition and metabolic problems.\n\"They're not good physically, mentally it's a very complicated issue,\" he says.\nIn the coming weeks, he notes, the bodies of dead hostages will also arrive, with plans in place to transfer them to a forensic laboratory before funerals in Israel.\nAfter receiving initial treatment at the reception point, the surviving hostages are transferred in a \"specially adapted\" helicopter to a hospital elsewhere in the country.\nCol Dr Banov says: \"We tell them… we will take a helicopter back home. And then, if you're willing to, we're going to start talking about what you have been through.\"\nIt is there that the proper recovery process begins.\nThe Israeli military says it targeted what it describes as \"armed terrorists\" in the town of Tamoun.\nLebanon and the US said the agreement will remain in place until 18 February.\nIt comes as the deadline passes for Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters to withdraw from southern Lebanon.\nThe missile strike on a Lebanese apartment block targeting Hezbollah left mostly civilians dead, BBC finds.\nTwelve Palestinians are reported to have been killed since a major operation began in Jenin on Tuesday.",

    "text": "Matthew Mott and Australia beat England in the final of the World Cup in 2022\nFormer England men's white-ball coach Matthew Mott says he would \"never say never\" about coaching the women's side.\nMott and Jos Buttler led England to T20 World Cup glory in 2022 but the Australian stepped down in July last year.\nHe previously had great success with Australia's women alongside captain Meg Lanning, winning two T20 world titles, the 50-over World Cup, while they were unbeaten in four Ashes series.\nCurrent England boss Jon Lewis is under pressure as his side have lost all six white-ball matches on the tour of Australia so far, and are fighting to avoid a series clean sweep in the Melbourne Test.\n\"You never say never - but I am happy with what I'm doing,\" Mott told ABC Radio during the Test-match interval.\n\"There's a few things on the horizon for me and I'm excited about that. I've just had two months as assistant coach of Sydney Sixers and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am just looking at the next 12 to 18 month as a bit of a freshen up.\"\nEngland have experienced a tumultuous month in Australia, with drama unfolding off the pitch alongside the disappointing results on it.\nBefore the first T20 of the series in Sydney, which Australia eventually won by 57 runs, England spinner Sophie Ecclestone refused to give an interview with pundit and former player Alex Hartley.\nThat led to Hartley saying she had been given the\"cold shoulder\"by the team after she criticised their fitness in November, which then reignited the debate around England's athleticism and fielding in comparison to Australia.\nLewis was then the subject of derision in some parts of the media after he suggested Australia's cricketersbenefited from a better climate.\nMott, 51, was not asked about Lewis' comments but provided insight into what made his and Lanning's side so formidable.\n\"We basically had a mantra that every day was an opportunity to get a little bit better,\" Mott explained.\n\"I think the honesty that the group had around performance was impressive. We didn't immediately debrief after a performance because the emotions were there, but we did always have a structured day where we acknowledged areas we could get better.\n\"Some of the greats of the game - Perry and Lanning - admitting they made mistakes was very empowering for young players to put their hand up on how they can improve.\"\nLanning retired from international cricket in 2023 and though Australia lost at the semi-final stage of their first World Cup after her departure in November, they have dominated the Women's Ashes in all aspects and appear to be building ominous form in order to defend their 50-over title in August and September this year.\nAfghan cricketers play first match since fleeing Taliban\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "A Leicester cinema and arts centre is proposing to cut its opening hours and reduce staff numbers to save money.\nThe Phoenix Cinema and Arts Centre, in the city's Cultural Centre, currently opens seven days a week but said it was looking to close on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from April.\nThe centre, run by a charitable trust, has told staff it expects to see a \"significant reduction\" in its annual £194,000 grant from Leicester City Council from April and could not absorb the cost.\nThe council said it had not made a final decision on the grant to Phoenix but added it was in an \"extremely difficult\" funding position itself.\nIn a briefing document for its 57 staff, seen by the BBC, Phoenix bosses said that as well as the loss of council funding the four-screen venue was facing significant rises in staff and operating costs.\n\"The charity has no option but to progress plans to save circa £200,000 in costs,\" the document said.\n\"This level of savings can only be made from payroll savings.\n\"Therefore, Phoenix cannot continue to operate in the same way.\"\nIt said reducing opening hours to five days a week and closing earlier on Sunday evenings \"may result in redundancies across the charity\" though no specific number of job losses has been released.\nSarah Vallance, co-chief executive of the Phoenix, said: \"We will try everything we can to minimise the need to make any redundancies.\n\"Consultations with staff are absolutely vital to that and that process is underway.\"\nMs Vallance told theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicethe charity would be looking for alternative sources of funding including looking to run more conferences for businesses.\nShe said she accepted the city council faced an \"enormous\" challenge with its own finances.\n\"It is essential that we reduce costs so we can rebuild our funds, improve our financial stability and secure Phoenix's future – this proposal is a vital step in that process.\" Ms Vallance added.\n\"This is an incredibly unsettling time for all Phoenix staff, as proposals are worked through.\"\nThe consultation with staff is under way as work on a £14m project toreplace  cladding on the Phoenix buildingand attached flats continues.\nA city council spokesperson said: \"Phoenix Arts has been affected by a number of issues, including the longer than anticipated recovery of cinema audiences, and the impact of the works taking place there.\n\"We have been talking to them for some time about our own extremely difficult funding position, and the need for us to take difficult decisions to balance our books.\n\"We have not yet made a final decision on this, and are considering all options, but it is prudent of the Phoenix trustees to plan on the assumption that we won't be able to continue to support them in the future.\"\nThe council will make a final decision on the grant when it decides its budget in February.\nFollow BBC Leicester onFacebook, onX, or onInstagram.

    "text": "NIFL CEO Gerard Lawlor and Irish FA president Conrad Kirkwood have reacted to the NI Executive's announcement\nThe Irish FA and Northern Ireland Football League [NIFL] have \"welcomed\" investment in local football from the Northern Ireland Executive but called for further funding.\nAfter initially being announced in 2011,£36.2 million will be provided by the NI Executiveto improve stadia and facilities for football clubs across Northern Ireland.\nOn Thursday, Communities minister Gordon Lyons announced that applications are open for clubs to receive a share of the funding.\nClubs who are eligible will be able to apply for a slice of the Northern Ireland Football Fund Performance Programme.\nIrish FA president Conrad Kirkwood says it is a \"positive step forward\" but \"long overdue\" and \"falls significantly short\".\nGerard Lawlor, chief executive of NIFL, says he welcomes the announcement with \"cautious optimism\".\nClubs in the men's Premiership, Championship and Premier Intermediate leagues and NIFL Women's Premiership are eligible to apply, along with League of Ireland outfit Derry City.\nNorthern Ireland football fund open for applications\nNI football grounds score £36m funding\nLawlor said the announcement was an \"important milestone\" but added that the \"current fund will unfortunately have nowhere near the impact as initially intended\".\nHe added: \"As the minister himself has stated, much more is needed to have the required impact.\"\nLawlor also pointed to the decision not to develop Casement Park ahead of the Euro 2028 finals and said a \"legacy\" needs to be implemented.\n\"In the correspondence to not develop Casement Park for Euro 2028, the Secretary of State and UK Sports Minister stated that they 'remained committed to building a legacy for football across the whole of the UK'.\n\"This is their big chance as now is the time to step up and deliver.\n\"The NI Football Fund requires more money. The Lord Justice Taylor Report was published in 1990 and football in Northern Ireland still hasn't received its proportion, so we strongly feel that UK Government funding is long overdue.\n\"We will continue to lobby and make our case to both the NI Executive and UK Government as the role and impact our member clubs play in their communities and society simply cannot be understated.\"\nIt was announced last year that Casement Park would not be redeveloped for the Euro 2028 finals\nIFA president Kirkwood added the funding allocated by Stormont falls \"significantly short of the Department for Communities' own estimated £200 million required to upgrade performance club grounds, grassroots facilities and establish a National Football Centre for Northern Ireland\".\nHe said that \"fit for purpose stadia\" will leave an impact for \"the people of Northern Ireland for generations to come\".\n\"We, alongside our partners at NIFL, are dedicated to working closely with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that our game benefits from the UK and Ireland's hosting of the UEFA Euro 2028 tournament.\"\nMinister Lyons admitted additional funding will be required and he is \"determined this is only the beginning\".\n\"It is my ambition that this is a rolling programme of awards and project delivery over the coming years,\" said Lyons, who added the funding goes \"beyond football\" and helps communities.\n\"This will require additional funding in due course and I will be seeking to sustain the fund with further investment from a range of sources.\"\nLyons has also pledged cash for grassroots football and a national training centre, but this is not included in the initial release of funds designed for clubs and their stadia.\nGlentoran's Oval ground was earmarked for £10 million when the sub-regional stadia funding was announced in 2011\nGlentoran manager Declan Devine believes the facilities for football in Northern Ireland \"needs to move with the times\".\nWhen the £36.2 million was initially announced in 2011, the club's Oval ground in east Belfast was earmarked for £10 million to help towards its redevelopment.\n\"If we want football in Northern Ireland to grow, we've got to provide our fans  - irrelevant of what club – with modern facilities to enjoy what is a brilliant product,\" said Devine.\n\"We need a hub which we can use all of the facilities for the people of east Belfast. We have to work with our community.\n\"We need to bring this back into the 2025 world because I left here in 1996, came back last year and the thing hasn't changed one bit.\"\nDevine, who has also managed Derry City and Bohemians in the League of Ireland, feels the stadia \"aren't up to scratch\" and that Larne's success in Europe will only be replicated with better facilities.\n\"We've just had a club qualify for the Conference League Group stages [in Larne],\" he said.\n\"If we want to showcase our country, we need to showcase our facilities. We need investment.\n\"If you look at the current Northern Ireland international team, the many players who have come through this league. We have a brilliant product.\n\"We have a brilliant future ahead of us but we need the stadia, the grounds and the clubs to be supported by our government to take us to the next level.\"",

    "text": "A 50-year-old man has been found guilty of the \"senseless and cowardly\" murder of his son's 30-year-old partner after he falsely claimed she was \"scamming\" him out of the deeds for his mother's house.\nSophie Evans's body was found lying face down and naked on the kitchen floor of a house in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, on 5 July 2024, after she was attacked and strangled.\nRichard Jones, from Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, admitted manslaughter with diminished responsibility but denied murder.\nA jury at Swansea Crown Court took less than three hours on Thursday to find him guilty of murder.\nThere were shouts of \"scumbag\" from the public gallery as Jones was sent down.\nThe court previously heard how, on the day of the attack, Ms Evans had just returned home to Bigyn Road from dropping off her two children at school when Jones visited.\nHe was said to have been a \"regular visitor\" carrying out \"odd jobs\" at the property.\nHe was arrested later the same day after exchanging multiple texts and phone calls with family and friends.\nThe jury saw an exchange between Jones and his former partner, Tracey Thompson, in which he called his son, Jamie Davies, and Ms Evans \"scamming thieves\" and said he had \"taken care of the problem\".\nIn psychiatrist interviews after his arrest, he said he believed he had been \"tricked\" out of the deeds for his mother's house by his son and Ms Evans.\nDuring police interviews, Jones told officers his \"head went\" over the \"scam\" and he was \"erratic\".\nHe said he remembered going to Ms Evans' house on the morning of the murder to look at drains at the property, adding he \"lost his head\" when she said \"nothing\" about the \"scam\".\nJones then said he did not remember anything about the attack, except being \"down the country park\" hours later.\n5 July 2024\nDavid Elias, defending Jones, said his client's thoughts about being scammed were \"falsely held beliefs\" caused by a delusional disorder.\nConsultant psychiatrist Dr Dilum Jayawickrama, who interviewed the accused, said Jones was \"100% certain in his beliefs\" he had been scammed.\nThe court heard Jones told officers he had been taken to a solicitor's office by Ms Evans to sign forms, leading him to believe he had signed over the deeds to his mother's house.\n\"There is not a single shred of evidence to say that was true,\" said Mr Elias.\nMike Jones, prosecuting, said Jones \"was not experiencing significant emotional distress\" at the time of the murder and showed \"callous indifference\" to what he did to her.\nMr Jones told the jury the defendant had \"by his own admission, a historic short fuse\", and on the day of the incident \"had lost his temper, attacked Sophie and strangled her, causing her death\".\nJudge Geraint Walters said the only sentence the court could pass was life imprisonment.\nJones will be sentenced on 3 March.\nFollowing the verdict, Det Supt Gareth Roberts said Dyfed-Powys Police welcomed the the decision reached by the jury.\n\"Richard Jones has been found guilty of what was a senseless, cowardly act triggered by anger and temper. Sophie was within her own home and not in a position to defend herself from Richard Jones's cruel act of violence.\n\"The family will take some comfort that he's now removed from society and cannot harm any others.\"\nThe body of Sophie Evans was found at a property in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, on 5 July 2024.\nRichard Jones believed his son and Sophie Evans had \"tricked\" him out of the deeds to a house.\nStroke victims are concerned changes could see them having to travel for hours to another unit.\nSophie Evans’s family has said they are “heartbroken by her loss” and that she will be missed.\nThe judge says the 64-year-old's murder was \"senseless and cruel\" and the killer showed no remorse.",

Paul Mullin has missed so many chances this season and from my perspective, he missed a sitter last night.

Wrexham need an injection of talented youth in midfield and up-front, we need players who bring a bit of energy and flair. We need to be more creative.\nDave:I think the squad is the strongest it's been for a long while (with the obvious influx of cash), although I think a new goal scorer is needed as Mullin's form has dipped.\nRalph:Phil Parkinson has not done Wrexham any favours playing these non-performers like Palmer, Mullin, O'Connor and McConnell. They're long past their sell-by dates. If Parkinson was a player on the pitch he would've have been dropped a long time ago. Very poor player management.\nJeff:Elliot Lee is is our top scorer this season with six goals, while the league's top scorer has 15. We need to buy a reliable goal scorer and quick, five days left. Super Paul Mullin is finished.\nAlfresco:We need a proven goal scorer up-front, it's as simple as that. I don't want to see us sign anyone with \"potential\", we need someone who is scoring goals now. I'm not interested in a \"project\" player. We need goals, now!\nJimbo:Do we really need to sign more players, we have an abundance of talent throughout our squad. We have a brilliant defence, great midfield and potentially a great strike force. We just need to get Paul Mullin back to his best by starting him a bit more.\nElwyn:We must get a striker if we want to challenge for automatic promotion. Paul Mullin has not hit the heights prior to his injury, Ollie Palmer has never been prolific and Steven Fletcher is 37-years-old. Although Fletcher has been in a rich vein of long-term form, he isn't the solution, Phil Parkinson never plays him for one reason or another.",

    "tags": "Rangers",
    "text": "Former Rangers manager Alex McLeish believes Philippe Clement's side are getting their swagger back as they look to continue momentum with a Europa League win over Union Saint-Gilloise tonight.\nRangers' 3-1 victory at Dundee United last weekend was their first Premiership away win in five attempts and McLeish was particularly impressed with the new front pairing of Hamza Igamane and Cyriel Dessers.\n\"I really thought there was a purpose about Rangers and a cloud had lifted after all the criticism of their away form,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio programme.\n\"I thought I saw a little change in the wind in the United game. It was a great 3-1 victory. They really took the game to United and playing with two centre forwards was a real novelty these days but very effective.\n\"For the first time this season watching Rangers away from home it was an inspirational performance.\"\nRangers are already guaranteed a Europa League play-off spot – and have a very slim chance of securing a top-eight finish and direct entry to the last 16 should they beat the Belgians and a series of other results go in their favour.\n\"Clement will demand the same again. Take the performance level, confidence and rhythm from the Dundee Utd game into this one,\" McLeish added.\n\"They had a fantastic performance in Nice [4-1 Europa League win in November] and Igamane was outstanding that night and has been ever since. To see him and Dessers together was quite amazing the other day. They looked very dangerous.\n\"Belgian teams have been terrific on the road but Rangers have a very good chance of winning this one and further cementing their confidence.\"",

I'm the last person who would have expected [reigning champions Manchester]Cityto have such a bad run.\"\nSlot signed a three-year contract with Liverpool last summer, and is already thinking how the club can improve.\n\"Liverpool should always be competing for a league title - we should always be competing for the Champions League. I'm hoping I will be able to keep the club at that level,\" he said.\n\"I know people sometimes question this because they haven't seen us doing a lot in the transfer market in the summer and now in the winter as well. There's a reason for that - because we're happy with the squad.\n\"But I do know we're definitely working on strengthening in the summer.\"\nDuring his playing days, Slot was a goalscoring attacking midfielder, twice winning promotion from the Dutch second division to the Eredivisie with FC Zwolle and also playing in the Uefa Cup with NAC Breda.\nBut a route into coaching was a natural progression for Slot, who managed Dutch sides Cambuur, AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord, where he won the league title, before moving to Liverpool.\n\"I don't think anyone that played with me is surprised I've become a manager,\" he added. \"It didn't take long before I thought 'I'm going to enjoy this for as long as I can and I definitely want to become a manager or a coach'.\"\nRead the full article on Slot's rise here",

    "text": "\"If you're going to cross the line, just don't come.\"\nThat's the message from St Johnstone owner Adam Webb.\nIn the wake of Stuart Kettlewell's exit at Motherwell - following back-to-back defeats in Perth - Webb was asked how football should handle abuse from fans.\n\"There's a fine line between passionate fandom and undue abuse,\" Webb said. \"And I understand the passion of being a fan. I've been a fan of clubs and teams all my life.\n\"Obviously, when you're angry, you want to take it out on somebody. In the age of social media, it's more easy than ever to go a little bit over the top. You're sitting in your living room on your couch and you can type anything you want.\n\"That can be very offensive and over the top. I think it's a question of personal responsibility for all of us.\"\nWhat is the club's responsibility, though, Webb said \"transparency is key\".\n\"It's to always be transparent, always be communicating,\" he added. \"I believe that if they know if the fans know you're doing everything you can, then they're less likely to get so over the top in their anger.\n\"And that's my vow to our fans.\n\"We've done everything we can do and we will be doing everything we can do. I'm open to their suggestions. I get emails every day from fans. I got several this morning that I was reviewing before coming over here, and we always take their ideas. We always consider their ideas and we always weigh everything accordingly. That's all we can do.\n\"We can't stop idiots from doing dumb things. If you're going to cross the line, we say you're not allowed to come, whether it be for a season or a few games or whatever the punishment may be.\n\"They have to understand there are repercussions when they take it too far.\"",

    "text": "The Home Office's response to the \"serious and growing problem\" of violence against women and girls (VAWG) has been ineffective, the UK's spending watchdog has said.\nIn areportpublished on Friday, the National Audit Office (NAO) said the department had \"not led an effective whole-system response\" to the rising incidence of rape and sexual assault recorded by police.\nIts efforts as the lead on the government's response to VAWG have so far \"not improved outcomes\" for victims, the report found.\nA Home Office spokesperson said the report had looked at the previous government's \"failure to deliver systemic change\", and that Labour was \"delivering a step-change in the government's response\".\nThe report noted that three separate strategies aimed at reducing VAWG have been published since 2010, when the Conservative party began its 14 years in power.\nBut the NAO said its own analysis of Office for National Statistics data showed the percentage of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales to have suffered a sexual assault was estimated to be 4.3% in 2023-24, up from 3.4% in 2009-10.\nIt said incidents of rape and sexual assault recorded by police had increased almost fourfold during the same period, from 34,000 to 123,000 - but cautioned that this could be partially explained by improved recording of these crimes.\nThe NAO also found \"little evidence\" that the Home Office had improved on earlier strategies, while the department and the wider government had \"a poor understanding of what works to prevent and tackle VAWG\".\nThe report added that as part of the 2021 strategy, at least £4.2m had been spent on research into preventing VAWG, but the projects it funded were \"yet to provide insights to inform any future interventions\".\nThe report noted that \"low charge rate and long wait times\" contributed to a considerable number of rape victims dropping out before cases reached a conviction.\nMeanwhile, only a minority of domestic abuse cases recorded by police led to charges, the NAO said.\nIn 2021, under the previous Conservative government, the department created a dedicated team to lead VAWG strategy.\nThe NAO said the Home Office \"found it challenging to get buy-in from other government departments\" and had a \"limited understanding\" of the extent of resources devoted to addressing VAWG across government.\nIts dedicated team did not meet until a year after the launch, the NAO found, and had only met four times in total.\nThe Home Office \"does not know what effect the government's work is having on VAWG\", the report said.\nThe NAO said: \"Government's efforts to tackle violence against women and girls have not yet improved outcomes for the victims of these crimes.\n\"The lack of an effective, cross-government approach and a limited understanding of what works to help reduce these crimes, means the Home Office cannot be confident that government is doing the best it can to keep women and girls safe.\"\nWhile in opposition,Labour pledged to halve VAWGin a decade.\nThe report said the new government had set an \"ambitious target\", but that to meet it the Home Office would need to \"lead a coordinated, whole-system response that addresses the causes of VAWG\".\nAndrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: \"The lack of attention to prevention is deplorable, especially as we know VAWG is significantly under-reported.\"\nBut she added that the strategy's \"worth\" could not \"be determined solely on a value-for-money basis\".\n\"The harms of VAWG are so significant and far-reaching that the societal importance of addressing it must be recognised,\" Ms Simon said.\nAbigail Ampofo, interim CEO of Refuge, said the report's findings \"come as no surprise\".\n\"We know all too well VAWG is horrifically common,\" she added.\n\"And yet, confidence in the justice system is at an all-time low, and every day survivors continue to be failed, which is having devastating and at times, fatal consequences.\"\nThe Asylum seeker barge, Bibby Stockholm, has been pictured leaving Portland 18 months after it arrived.\nBorder officials will also get powers to seize migrants' phones, under new laws unveiled by the Home Office.\nDan Jarvis says Islamist extremism, followed by far-right extremism, are the biggest threats the UK faces.\nThe women dressed up in wigs and disguises to take tests on behalf of others, say investigators.\nChief Constable Tim Smith said there has been huge costs associated with policing the dog law.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "Plans to build a new mainline railway station in eastern Cardiff have been approved by Wales' first minister.\nThe developers behind Cardiff Parkway had been waiting for a decision after the original planning application was called in for review by the Welsh government in October 2022.\nEluned Morgan confirmed she was granting planning permission in a letter sent to Cardiff Parkway Developments, which is overseeing the project in the St Mellons area, which the council leader said will boost transport and bring \"economic growth and job creation\".\nThe Welsh government said a \"statutory challenge period\" meant it could not comment further.\nCardiff Parkway will include a railway station with four platforms and a business park.\nDevelopers had hoped the station would be operational by 2024, but the planning process was dogged by delays.\nPlans were approved by Cardiff council in April 2022, but the broader national interest in the project led the Welsh government to review the application.\nEarlier this month, Cardiff's Labour council leader, Huw Thomas,criticised the \"inexplicable\" and \"indefensible\"time taken by the Welsh government to make a decision.\nThe Welsh government has a minority stake in the organisation, with the majority controlled by Investec and the Roberts family.\nA formal period has now begun in which a legal challenge can follow planning decisions like this.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"The reasons for the decision are set out in full in the decision letter. We cannot comment further while the statutory challenge period is in place.\"\nRuth Grant, who lives near to the site, said she thought the plans were \"great\".\n\"When I first moved up here they said that we'd have that, and that was 30 years ago,\" she added.\n\"It'll also be useful to have more shops, there's none really down my end of town.\"\nLindsey Gage agreed the new rail station would make travel \"so much easier\" for local residents like her.\n\"It will definitely cut down travel time to the centre,\" she said.\n\"It can take up to 50 minutes for us at the moment, so it's a good thing.\"\nMartha Mhepo said she hoped the development would bring more people to the area, but Alan Hillman worried it would \"ruin the environment\" in the local area.\n\"I also don't think it'll pay for itself and there's only one road in and out there which is already congested as it is,\" said Mr Hillman.\n\"This development won't give enough benefits to the area for what it would cost.\"\nNigel Roberts, chairman of Cardiff Parkway Developments, said the project would be \"a sustainable, well-connected business district with public transport and active travel at its heart\".\nHe said it would \"bring opportunities to our local communities, the city region and the wider economy\", and thanked residents and the Welsh government for backing the plans.\nCardiff Parkway Developments said the station and the 60,000 sq ft business park \"could support up to 6,000 jobs\" and would provide a sustainable transport hub for eastern Cardiff.\nThe team will now draw up \"a programme for delivery\".\nCardiff has 20 railway stations, but none are located in the east of the city.\nThe CF3 postcode area, serving the eastern suburbs of St Mellons, Trowbridge, Rumney and Llanrumney, is home to more than 40,000 people.\nBus journeys from St Mellons to Cardiff city centre can take up to one hour, compared with a 25-minute car journey, but a train service could mean journey times of just seven minutes.\nThomas said he was \"delighted\" by the decision to approve the project.\nHe said Cardiff Parkway would \"significantly improve our transport infrastructure, leading to economic growth and job creation\" across the city and the wider region.\n\"With journey times between Cardiff and Newport reduced to just seven minutes, more than 800,000 passengers a year could benefit once this is up and running,\" he added.\n\"This project will help tackle traffic congestion from the east of Cardiff providing a game-changing public transport option for a part of the city which has suffered for far too long with connection issues.\n\"Additionally, sustainable transport options like cycle paths and walking routes will promote a greener, healthier lifestyle.\"\nAs Cardiff Parkway plans are approved, BBC Wales asks city centre commuters what they think.\nEx-minister says it shows policy was the most successful road safety initiative in modern times.\nTaxing overnight stays could help Cardiff fund hosting concerts and sports matches, says Huw Thomas\nTracy Turner, 51, an operating theatre assistant has been accused of planning to murder a child.\nWelsh government criticised for allegedly abdicating responsibility over Cardiff University cuts.",

    "tags": "Chelsea, Premier League, Football",
    "text": "There was perhaps a sense of irony come Saturday evening when Robert Sanchez made a mistake that contributed to Chelsea's 3-1 defeat byManchester City, with on-loan goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga having already kept a clean sheet forBournemouthin a win that took them level on points with the Blues.\nSanchez's latest mishap once again shone a light on an area of the pitch Chelsea have struggled with since Todd Boehly and Clearklake Capital's takeover in 2022.\nThey inherited a club that already had the world's most expensive goalkeeper and another that had won the Champions League and Fifa Club World Cup just months earlier.\nDespite that, they have since recruited four more, and have racked up an astonishing eight senior goalkeepers on their books.\nAnd yet, it still feels like the position most in need of more transfer business.\nHaving recently recalled Trevoh Chalobah from his loan spell - who had been out in the cold at the beginning of the season - should Chelsea be looking at goalkeeping options already on their books but playing elsewhere?\nNot a Chelsea fan? Find and follow your team here\nWhile he too has caused his own headlines in the past, an experienced 30-year-old Arrizabalaga could be what Chelsea need to bring a sense of stability to an inexperienced backline.\nWith five, Sanchez is now joint-top of the list of keepers for errors leading to goals in the Premier League this season. Arrizabalaga on the other hand has made just one.\nDespite having played five fewer games, the current Cherries shot-stopper has kept more clean sheets (five) than Sanchez (four).\nHe also just edges it in saves made per 90 minutes (3.4 to 3.6), total goals conceded (19 to 27) and overall save percentage with 75% compared to 72%.\nOne of the reasons Sanchez became, and has remained, as Maresca's number one is the Blues boss needs a goalkeeper to be able to play out from the back.\nAnd while the Spaniard does attempt more passes per 90 than Arrizabalaga (34.5 to 28.1), their accuracy is still incredibly similar at 69.75% and 69.27% respectively.\nThere is often a noticeable sense of unease around the stadium when the ball is at Sanchez's feet and he appears to struggle when it comes to distribution further up the pitch.\nIn fact, the formerBrightonkeeper's long pass accuracy is well down on that of his Spanish counterpart at 29% compared to Arrizabalaga's 43%.\nChelsea have had a rich history of goalkeepers, and if they are to challenge those at the top in coming seasons it is clear they will need a world-class option.\nNeither Sanchez or Arrizabalaga are likely to be that long term but, in the short term, they need someone to steady the defensive ship.\nWhat do you think, Blues fans? Should the club look at bringing Kepa back? Or is Sanchez still the right choice?\nLet us know",

    "text": "The UK's choice for the next ambassador to the US, Lord Peter Mandelson, has described his previous criticism of Donald Trump as \"ill-judged and wrong\".\nSpeaking in an interview with US broadcaster Fox News, he said the new US president had won \"fresh respect\" from him, adding he was \"quite confident\" Trump  would approve of his appointment.\nAs part of the process Lord Mandelson's credentials have to be presented to Trump, which the president is reportedly expected to agree to.\nIn previous years, Lord Mandelson has described Trump as \"reckless\" and \"a bully\".\nIn an interview with an Italian journalist in 2019, he described Trump as \"reckless and a danger to the world\".\nThis followed a 2018 interview with the Evening Standard where he described Trump as \"a bully\".\nBut he toldFox News: \"I made those remarks six years ago in 2019, led rather along this by an Italian journalist... it was a time in Britain by the way with very fraught politics and there was high emotion about many things in Britain at that time.\n\"I consider my remarks about President Trump as ill-judged and wrong.\n\"And I think that time and attitudes towards the president has changed since then.\"\nAcknowledging Trump's \"extraordinary\" second mandate, Lord Mandelson said Trump had won \"fresh respect\" from him and said he had heard nothing from the White House that suggested there was going to be any difficulty about his appointment.\n\"I think that President Trump will look at my credentials and consider what's best for the relationship going forward, \" he said.\n\"The president is a nice person, is a fair-minded person, and that's why I feel quite confident that, when as I say he does look at my credentials he'll think 'right, I think this guy could work well for both our countries and our special relationship'.\"\nHe added Trump could be \"one of the most consequential\" US presidents.\nThe government is much less concerned than previously about the possibility that Lord Mandelson's appointment could be blocked by Trump.\nSome of the president's allies had suggested that the president could take the extraordinary step of blocking him from taking up the role.\nTrump's co-presidential campaign manager Chris LaCivita last month warned Lord Mandelson to \"stay home\" and called him \"an absolute moron\" over his past comments on Trump.\nBut Lord Mandelson is understood to have now received his \"agrément\" from the US government – a formal step confirming their willingness to accept him as a diplomat in their country.\nThe final hurdle will come when Lord Mandelson presents his \"letter of credence\" to Trump.\nIt is understood that he is likely to fly to Washington DC to carry out the final formalities next week.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"Lord Mandelson is HMA-designate and the formal diplomatic process is ongoing.\"\nThe US State Department has alsobeen contacted for comment.\nMandelson's comments go further than others in government in recanting previous criticism of Trump.\nOthers in government such as the Foreign Secretary David Lammy have typically sought to deflect questions about their attacks on Trump by pointing out that many senior Republican politicians have previously criticised him too.\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had his first phone call with Trump since the inauguration, but its is thought Lord Mandelson's appointment was not discussed.\nLord Mandelson is a well-known figure in British politics, having served in multiple ministerial roles under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before taking up a life peerage in the Lords.\nHe was appointed by Sir Keir in December and will replace outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce, the first woman to serve as UK ambassador to the US.",

    "text": "We asked for your views on how Everton will cope without Dominic Calvert-Lewin and where the goals might come from.\nHere are some of your comments:\nDon:Everton have Michael Keane who can score with his head and he is a good shooter. Why not use him until the end of season as a centre-forward? That's what they did way back. Remember Fred Pickering? He used to be a full-back. He was big and strong had a shot on him like a mule. Keane has scored some cracking goals for us.\nSteve:Just a thought, but how about giving Keane a run upfront? He's scored a few before and could help Beto score a few.\nDan:Like every team we need someone who can put the ball in the back of the net. We might as well cancel Armando Broja's loan if possible and try someone else. I just hope we can find another Kevin Campbell from somewhere! With 12 players out of contract this summer, I don't know how we are going to be able to afford to rebuild this squad under profit and sustainability restrictions. We have got to hope we have some academy graduates who suddenly develop into Wayne Rooney.\nNot an Everton fan? Find and follow your club here\nBarry:David Moyes will have to be backed in the transfer market for attacking reinforcements. Central midfield is looking better with James Garner and Tim Iroegbunam coming back, but our creative options upfront and immediately behind are scarce. Beto and Abdoulaye Doucoure will likely be first choice but after that the cupboard is distinctly bare. If there are no other incomings, Keane might become a makeshift forward. It also begs the question, will anyone take a chance on DCL with his injury record, even on a free?\nPete:DCL is not a big loss. He's looked low on confidence, fitness, desire and has scored just three goals and made one assist this season. His latest goal against Tottenham was his first in 4 months. Dominic has appeared 22 times this season for Everton but yet only played 90 minutes eight times - you can't score if you're not on the pitch. I always think it's worth a punt on getting a cheap young enthusiastic player on loan -  you never know how well it could work out.\nMark:As well seeing if there is a proven goal scorer out there - before the transfer window ends. Is it time for Everton to give  some pitch minutes to one or two young strikers at the club, who don't have Premier League experience? There's no point developing young players in the academy, if you never take a risk and give them a chance. There may be a star striker right under Moyes' nose!",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Poultry farmers are appealing to the government to let them vaccinate their flocks against the \"devastating\" bird flu virus spreading across the UK.\nVaccinating poultry against avian influenza is currently not allowed in the UK. The government says that strong biosecurity measures and culling are the most effective ways of fighting it. Meanwhile, there are concerns that poultry vaccinations might be linked to the virus evolving.\nOverall levels of the virus have not yet reached the peak of recent years.\nBut one farmer, who has previously lost 30% of his flock because of bird flu, told the BBC that, without a vaccine, it was only a matter of time before \"it all kicks off again\".\nA bird flu prevention zone enforcing strict hygiene standards around domesticated birds has been declared for England, Wales and Scotland amid a rising number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\nThe risk to humans remains low, with chicken and eggs safe to eat if properly cooked, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).\nDefra has set up a cross-government and poultry industry taskforce that is looking at the potential use of vaccines, and is due to publish its report later this year. But poultry farmers say things are moving too slowly.\nEssex turkey farmer Paul Kelly, whose business was hit hard in the worst avian flu outbreak from 2021 to 2023, told the BBC that \"the foot has been taken off the gas\" when it comes to making poultry vaccines available to UK farmers.\n\"This is poor planning as we need to be ready for another huge outbreak as opposed to reacting to another outbreak and being behind the curve on rolling out vaccination,\" he said.\n\"Avian influenza is so highly pathogenic that if a farmer gets it [in his flock][ it is devastating.\"\nThere have so far been 25 farm outbreaks of bird flu since the annual winter recording season began in October.\nIn comparison, between October 2021 and January 2022, during the UK's worst outbreak, there had been more than 70 cases in poultry or other captive birds.\nBut Gary Ford, of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association, said that there was still \"panic, concern and fear out there\" among farmers over the virus spreading.\nHe added that the organisation was a \"huge supporter\" of vaccination for poultry but recognised there were challenges, including the cost to farmers and the impact on trade with other countries that prohibit imports from producers that vaccinate.\nMeanwhile, there have also been some scientific questions raised about bird flu vaccinations.\nRecent workby researchers from the UK's Royal Veterinary College and institutions in China found possible evidence that they may be linked to changes in how the virus evolves.\nThey carried out genetic analysis of avian flu samples collected from wild birds and farmed poultry between 1996 and 2023.\nWhile they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.\nThey said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.\nEarlier this week, the government agency that deals with infectious diseases, UKHSA,confirmed a case of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in a farm worker in the West Midlands region.\nIt said bird-to-human transmission of avian influenza was rare and that the risk to the wider public continues to be very low.\nFarmers in Shropshire, North Yorkshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, City of Kingston Upon Hull, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk have to keep their birds caged under mandatory housing rules put in place to manage the spread.\nBiosecurity restrictions are also in place across England, Wales and Scotland as part of an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone.\nThe National Farmers' Union said it was \"essential that Defra refocuses efforts\" on coming up with a workable avian influenza vaccination plan for the UK.\nThe government currently only allows licensed zoos to vaccinate captive birds against HPAI.\nIt said it would continue to invest in research and that any future decisions on the use of emergency or preventive vaccination would be based on the latest scientific evidence and veterinary advice.\nResearchers hope science used in Covid vaccines can limit the impact of the winter vomiting bug.\nA number of senators grilled the controversial nominee over his views on vaccines and abortion.\nKarl Franklin is swapping his day job on a farm for the quest editor seat at BBC Radio Oxford.\nSteve Witherden says an elderly farmer and his wife said \"if only I could die now\" to avoid the tax.\nIn some cities, as many as one in four office spaces are vacant. Some start-ups are giving them a second life – as indoor farms growing crops as varied as kale, cucumber and herbs.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "A Guernsey deputy has called for the way medication is prescribed in the island to be changed.\nIn a rule 14 question to Health and Social Care (HSC), deputy Andy Cameron asked why the committee had not implemented a \"pharmacist-led\" repeat prescription system.\nStudent Isabel Pontin, who needs medication to treat Crohn's disease, said the system was a \"hassle\" and difficult to afford.\nResponding to Deputy Cameron's question, HSC said: \"The committee has previously considered and supported recommendations to further explore changes which might benefit patients with regards to repeat prescriptions.\"\nAt present, patients on long term medication in Guernsey must get a new prescription by visiting their GP every six months, at an average cost of £70.50 per appointment.\nIn the UK prescriptions can be sent electronically through the NHS App, without the need for a doctor's appointment.\nDeputy Cameron claimed the need to see a doctor for a repeat prescription was costing islanders millions of pounds a year.\n\"If we look at the UK, 43% of the population are on repeat prescriptions,\" he said.\n\"If we transfer that over to Guernsey, at £70 per appointment every three months that roughly equates to £8m going into GP practices, rather than staying in the public's pockets.\"\nMiss Pontin is a student at university in the UK but, due to issues transferring her care, she still collects her prescriptions from Guernsey.\nShe said: \"As a uni student, it is not something you budget for and it wasn't something when I got diagnosed, that I thought I would have to budget for.\n\"With this treatment I am okay most of the time, so it's just a small chat to get a prescription which I don't think you should have to pay 70 quid for.\"\nDeputy Cameron said people he had spoken to were \"extremely annoyed\" about the system.\nHe said: \"It's an inefficient use of their time, a pharmacy would be much better suited to issue these prescriptions.\"\nGP fees roseearlier this month, with one medical group telling the BBC that inflation, medical insurance and staff expenses had all contributed to the hike.\nDeputy Cameron said it would be \"morally wrong\" if surgeries were using the money from prescription appointments to \"bolster them up\".\nIn a response to Cameron, the HSC committee said: \"Some provisional scoping has been undertaken but the substantive policy, contractual and legislative changes required to facilitate such changes, and the associated funding, will be explored as part of the strategic portfolio for sustainable health and care in the Government Work Plan 2025-29.\n\"The committee remains supportive of primary care and pharmacy reform, which could see an expansion of services provided by community pharmacies.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey onXandFacebook.

    "text": "When Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers scored twice inside the opening five minutes, you feared the worst for Celtic.\nVilla's movement, their slick passing and the quickness of their play was scintillating and Celtic must have wondered what had hit them.\nIt could have knocked the stuffing out of them, but in fairness to the Scottish champions they grew into the match and started to get forward and create chances.\nThat seemed to give them belief, and from there they showed great character and resilience to get back into a game that looked lost. Adam Idah's brilliant finishes on 35 and 37 minutes came about after some superb build-up play from the visitors.\nHowever, the home side upped the ante after the break and a third goal felt inevitable.\nDespite taking a bit of confidence from Ollie Watkins' bizarre penalty miss, Celtic in the end were undone by Villa's quality, and overall the hosts deserved their win.\nBut Celtic can take heart from much of what they showed against an impressive side, and they'll take that into the Champions League play-off round.",

Our saving grace is that we're out at work.\"\nShe said she would like \"a bit of hope that they are doing something and we are not left in limbo\".\n\"The best outcome is that I would see an NIE van beyond my lane and having my wires up to connect the power supply back to my home.\"\nOn Tuesday, Communities Minister Gordon Lyons pledged £1m to support communities and individuals affected by the storm.\n\"Storm Eowyn has caused devastation, and my primary concern is the safety and well-being of all those affected, particularly children, the elderly and people with vulnerabilities,\" Mr Lyons said.\nLyons said Stormont departments would do everything possible to help support those who have found themselves homeless and for those needing assistance.\nEarlier in the week,the first minister and deputy first ministers called on NIE to \"step up\"and provide a \"goodwill payment\" to those still without power.\nRonan McKeown, from NIE, has said that conversations on compensation payments would continue between NIE, Stormont ministers, the Department for the Economy and Utility Regulator.\nMs Graham said she believes NIE should be looking at goodwill payments now.\n\"Every bit of food in the fridge is ruined and when the electric comes back on we will have to replace it.\"\nSarah Craig lives on the outskirts of Stewartstown in County Tyrone.\nShe and her four-year-old daughter are into day six of not having any power at their home.\n\"The storm started on Friday morning and the electric went off, six days later, here we are, still with no electric.\"\nSpeaking to BBC News NI she added: \"In the bedrooms at night you can see your breath, my daughter's room is freezing, she's had to come and sleep with us at some stages it's been that cold.\"\nSarah lives opposite a preschool and earlier this week noticed an extremely dangerous situation unfolding.\nShe said: \"I was actually taking my bin down and happened to glance across the road and noticed that the chain holding the padlock to the school gates was glowing.\"\nWhile Sarah investigated further she noticed the whole fence was live due to power lines that had fallen onto it during the storm, she said she \"contacted local councillors and NIE and NIE came out around 7pm\".\n\"NIE confirmed that the whole fence was live and the fire brigade had to come out, because there was smoke coming out of the gate, so obviously the live fence had started to smoulder the hedge, but the fire brigade were very quick to come out and NIE said they turned off the power connected to it,\" she explained.\nRuadhrai O'Kane, who is part of the incident team for NIE Networks, told Good Morning Ulster that Monday, 3 February, is the most \"realistic\" date for the worst-affected customers to have their power restored.\n\"We are trying to be as realistic as we can to try to give people time to make any arrangements they can,\" said Mr O'Kane.\n\"We are doing all that we can to restore power to people as quickly as we can. We have meter readers going out to do checks with vulnerable customers and community assistant centres.\"\nHe said that NIE has been getting support from other companies across Great Britain, while engineers have even arrived from Finland.\n\"We probably have 1,400 people working tirelessly and flat out to restore electricity supply as quickly as we can... it's our primary focus at the minute.\"\nOn the question of goodwill payments, he said, NIE are \"engaging with multiple agencies to try and provide the support that we can\".\nIn the Republic of Ireland, more than 142,000 properties remain without supply, according to ESB Networks - down from a peak of about 768,000 on Friday morning.\nThe storm had also affected water supplies in some parts of Northern Ireland.\nNI Water now say that all their customers should have their water supply as normal.\nThe aftermath of the storm has also affected schools, with some in Northern Ireland still closed on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the National Trust has said the storm \"wreaked havoc\" on its estates and gardens in Northern Ireland.\nIt estimates that 10,000 trees in Mount Stewart, County Down, were \"flattened\" by hurricane force winds\nWinds of up to 90mph left Rowallane Garden in Saintfield \"almost unrecognisable\" with irreplaceable specimen trees permanently lost, some more than 250 years old, as well as rare and exotic species and rhododendrons planted by the estate's former owner, Hugh Armytage Moor, in the 1870s.\nSome of the trust's properties remain closed as the damage is assessed and clean-up work gets under way.\nNIE has said there are11 Community Assistance Centresand more than 60 drop-in centres open until 19:00 GMT to help those without power.\nFacilities offered range from showers, food, hot drinks, and work-from-home hubs. NIE Networks reps are available for support.\nTo report faults or emergencies you should contact:\nNorthern Ireland Housing Executive: 03448 920 901\nOpenreach Damages to Network: 08000 23 20 23 (Individual faults must be logged with Communications Providers)\nGas networks: 0800 002001\nNI Water: 03457 44 00 88 or visit niwater.com, external\nFlooding Incident Line: 0300 2000 100\nNIE Networks: 03457 643 643 or visitnienetworks.co.uk\nA councillor will tell a floods conference how it feels when water swamps your home.\nA \"vital\" generator and trailer has been stolen from NI Water from a site near Omagh\nIan Bebbington says there might come a point where the West Mid Showground has to be cleared.\nExperts from Jersey were sent to Northern Ireland after Storm Éowyn caused widespread power cuts.\nSome train services are still affected by storm damage with 2,800 households still without power.",

Even with the crowd split between the two teams, the roars and cheers were still reverberating from below, ricocheting off the roof and hammering our ear drums.\nThen it happened. Our monitors went off, the scoreboard disappeared, the stadium announcer's booming voice was silenced and the majority of the stadium's lights went out.\nApart from some emergency lighting, darkness engulfed the Superdome. And silence. Such an eerie experience in such a huge building.\nA riotous cauldron of noise was turned into a shadowy cavern of worried murmurings and disbelief - with nobody having a clue what was happening.\nPlayers searched for their families in the stands, some stretched and some just sat down, bemused, as NFL officials ran about looking to find what the problem was, and the solution.\nThere was precious little communication, as we tried to call, email, get in contact with someone, somewhere, with some knowledge of the situation.\nOnce the spectre of something more threatening was ruled out, a power outage was given as the reason, and after the most famous half an hour of darkness in American sports history, we were ready to get back under way.\nThe silence heard around the world was broken, the blackout watched by hundreds of millions was over - but the story was very much not.\nThe Super Bowl blackout was caused by a faulty relay device\nWhen the lights came back on, it was like the two sides had switched shirts, as a Baltimore team that had dominated to lead 28-6 had lost all their momentum.\nJones' incredible 108-yard touchdown to start the second half was long forgotten, and Kaepernick engineered a run of 17 points scored in just over four minutes.\nEven after a late Ravens field goal, the 49ers had one last chance to score and win the game, before a discombobulated Ravens defence finally stopped them to win 34-31.\nA one-sided beatdown had become a nail-biting thriller, but plenty of Ravens were not happy with lots of conspiracy theories about whether somebody had actually pulled the plug.\n\"I'm not gonna accuse nobody of nothing - because I don't know facts,\" said a chuckling Lewis in the NFL's America's Game series released shortly after the incident.\n\"But you're a zillion-dollar company, and your lights go out? No. No way.\"\nThe blackout undoubtedly changed the game - it took the wind out of Baltimore's sails and gave San Francisco time to regroup - but it ultimately did not change the outcome.\nNow if the 49ers had completed their comeback and lifted the Lombardi Trophy instead of Lewis and his Ravens, that would be a different story.\nRay Lewis (centre) believes the Super Bowl blackout was no accident\nAn investigation traced the problem to a relay device - ironically something to protect the stadium from power problems - and something not even inside the Superdome.\nUsually a more regular Super Bowl host city, New Orleans has had to wait 12 years to put the 'Blackout Bowl' right - and the host committee and local power company are taking no chances.\nEntergy has replaced all of the systems used 12 years ago and the Superdome has had a sizeable makeover, including new LED lights that take far less time to switch back on.\nA reason for the blackout lasting 34 minutes was the reboot time of the old lighting system.\n\"We're very confident in terms of the three feeds we have there,\" Entergy'sShelton Hudson told media,externalbefore Super Bowl week.\nAll systems have been given thorough checks during big Superdome events such as concerts by Beyonce and, ironically enough, the world's biggest Kansas City Chiefs fan,Taylor Swift.\nThe Super Bowl is another level though, and the Superdome will be under scrutiny to make sure there are no problems this time around.\nTwelve years is a long time to change a few lightbulbs, and with the world watching again, the Superdome and NFL officials will be keeping their fingers crossed.\nHopefully the NFL's leading lights on the field will be making all the headlines this time around.\nGet NFL news & reports sent straight to your phone",

He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023.

It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles.\nBorn: 2003\nBorn in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter.\nBorn: 1950\nAnne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter.

He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012.\nThe children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles.\nPeter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020.\nBorn: 2010\nSavannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild.\nBorn: 2012\nIsla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.\nBorn: 1981\nZara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics.

    "tags": "Wales Sport",
    "text": "Jim Driscoll died on 30 January, 1925 at the age of 44\nIf there is one criticism to be made of Cardiff, the location of its statues would be a valid one.\nWere you aware of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi among the trees just a stone's throw away from the Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay? Gareth Edwards lurks outside a Primark store in the indoor St David's shopping centre.\nYou might even have wandered past the Radisson Hotel in the middle of the city without noticing one of the nation's sporting giants standing proudly on a plinth by the main road.\nIt's impossible to compare Jim Driscoll - who died 100 years ago this January - with any other boxer or athlete in Welsh sporting history, and that's to be expected when you consider his nickname.\nOriginally erected in 1997 near the site of the former Central Boys Club, Jim Driscoll's statue was moved to its current location in 2009\n'Peerless Jim' was born in the Adamsdown area of Cardiff in 1880.\nWhen he died aged 44 in 1925, some 100,000 people came on to the streets to pay their respects.\nOften, when sportsmen reach the upper echelons of pubic renown, it is due to their contribution away from their field.\nConsider Muhammad Ali, or even South Africa's rugby union captain Siya Kolisi, two greats who are recognised for their actions and social sacrifices alongside their sporting successes.\nWithin the context of Driscoll, personal sacrifice was responsible for the respect directed his way.\nHe gave up the chance to reach the peak of his sport because he promised to support his community.\nThe son of an Irish immigrant, Driscoll had a tough upbringing in desperate poverty at the end of the 19th century.\nHis father died after being hit by a train when Jim was only one.\nHis mother had to depend on the support of the church to help with raising her children, as well as maintaining her tough labouring job of loading potatoes and fish from the boats at the docks in Cardiff Bay.\nFreddie Welsh of Wales avoids fellow countryman Jim Driscoll's left glove during their contest at Cardiff - Driscoll was disqualified for butting Welsh in the third round\nDriscoll developed his art form in boxing booths.\nDriscoll, like other legendary Welsh boxers Jimmy Wilde and Tommy Farr, would travel Britain's fairs and carnivals challenging any one of the public who would be foolish enough to pay for the misfortune of stepping in the ring with him.\nThis meant battling with every size and shape, and doing so for hours.\nThe old legend goes that Driscoll would often stand on a handkerchief with his hands tied behind his back, challenging opponents to hit him on the nose.\nIt is estimated that Driscoll racked up over 600 unofficial fights in these boxing booths, and by 1901 he was ready to take the step forward into the professional ladder.\nHe went on for seven years in England and Wales before turning his sights towards the United States of America.\nWith his slick style and his ability to avoid punches by dancing around the ring, many people prophesised that the Welshman would be the next featherweight champion of the world.\nIn 1910 he finally got his chance, facing the champion Abe Attell.\nMost fights of the time followed the 'no-decision' rule, which meant that Driscoll would have to knock his opponent out to take the title away.\nAttell is said to have insisted that this rule be put in place ahead of his fight against 'Peerless Jim'.\nDriscoll controlled the fight, but after 10 rounds he couldn't finish off the American.\nThe fight had to have an official winner to please those that had bet on the fight, and the decision was unanimous.\nDriscoll was the winner, but because of the 'no-decision' rule the belt would not be his.\nDriscoll had the opportunity of a rematch, but he refused.\nHe had promised to perform at a show in Cardiff to raise money for the Nazareth House orphanage.\nTurning down his chance to win a world title, he declared: \"I never break a promise.\"\nDriscoll returned to Cardiff a hero for his unselfish actions. To many Driscoll was the unofficial world champion.\nDriscoll would fight again in the States, but following a period of illness, he was far off his best.\nWith the arrival of the First World War, and a series of other challenges, his opportunity to become world champion disappeared.\nHe is considered by many as the best British boxer to never win a world title.\nDriscoll died of tuberculosis on 30 January 1925.\nAs his coffin slowly made its way towards Cathays cemetery, thousands were on the streets of the Welsh capital, which at the time was home to only 200,000 residents.\nIf you were to visit the cemetery today - 100 years after his death - you would notice there are always flowers at his grave.\nWhich brings us back to the present.\nNext time you're shopping in Cardiff - and in particular the John Lewis department store - take the opportunity to leave through the back door.\nTake care when crossing four lanes of traffic, and there you will see, standing proud, a man with whom nobody compares.\nJim Driscoll was quite simply 'Peerless'.\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

A female bishop also told Channel 4 News she was sexually harassed by him.\nIn a statement, Bishop Perumbalath said he had \"consistently denied\" the allegations, adding police had investigated them but taken no further action.\nChannel 4 News said Bishop Perumbalath, who was enthroned Bishop of Liverpool in 2023, was interviewed voluntarily under caution by police in March last year.\nBishop Perumbalath said: \"The allegations set out in this programme are in relation to encounters that took place in public settings, with other people present.\n\"I have consistently denied the allegations made against me by both complainants.\n\"I have complied with any investigation from the National Safeguarding Team.\n\"The allegations raised in Essex were also investigated by the police who took no further action.\n\"Whilst I don't believe I have done anything wrong, I have taken seriously the lessons learnt through this process addressing how my actions can be perceived by others.\n\"I will comply with any investigation deemed necessary.\n\"I take safeguarding very seriously and work hard to provide proper leadership in this area\".\nThe Church of England said it had also investigated the complaints, with a complaint of alleged misconduct first made in early in 2023.\nA spokesperson said the investigation \"concluded that there were no ongoing safeguarding concerns, but a learning outcome was identified with which the bishop fully engaged\".\n\"The complaint was also investigated by the police which resulted in no further action.\"\nThe statement continued: \"Shortly after the start of this process a further disclosure was made by another woman.\n\"The information brought by the second complainant was explored and assessed not to be a safeguarding matter but a matter of alleged misconduct.\n\"Pastoral support has been provided throughout for the second complainant and is ongoing.\"\nOriginally from Kerala in South India, Bishop Perumbalath was ordained into the Church of North India in 1994.\nHe moved to the UK in 2001, first taking up positions in the Diocese of Rochester.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside onSoundsand follow BBC Merseyside onFacebook,X,andInstagram.\nManager Arne Slot says Liverpool want Mohamed Salah, who is out of contract in the summer, to sign a new deal.\nResidents say they are considering selling their homes over \"nightmare\" bills for parking.\nThe first double gameweek of the Fantasy Premier League season brings with it several dilemmas.

    "tags": "",
    "text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as sheunveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.\nBut how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?\nCritics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.\nBBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.\nThe most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.\nAnd the latest medium termofficial growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisisaverage growth of 2.8%a year.\nHowever, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.\nLower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.\nThe chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".\nShe cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050by 0.43%, around £17bn.\nThat is broadly in line withthe findings of an independent commissionby Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.\nHowever, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.\nAnd the government will have a difficult balancing act toboth expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.\nBBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"\nThe chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to £78bn to the UK economy by 2035\".\nThis corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.\nIn support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.\nThis research shows that this £78bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.\nThe analysis suggests the project could add £25bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.\nThat would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.\nEstimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.\nYet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.\nBen Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"\n\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.\n\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"\nAnother reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.\nDefined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.\nMany of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).\nThe Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to £160bn.\nThe chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.\nMeasuring the size of the surplus of defined benefit scheme depends on various complex assumptions about the scheme and its relationship to the employer.\nThe official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was £207bn, but £137bn on a different measurement.\nThe Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.\nIf such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.\nTotal business investment in 2023, according to official data, was £258bn.\nBut the size of any boost from this pension reform would depend on companies being willing to invest their surpluses, which is subject to great uncertainty as many firms have been looking to offload their defined benefit pension schemes to insurance companies in recent years.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Six years after the Royal Marines opened its elite ranks to women, it is still searching for its first female. New figures show that more than 900 women have applied but none have reached the finish line.\nNow two women who have experienced gruelling training with the Royal Marines say it is only a matter of time before a woman completes the ultimate military test.\n\"It was knackering and exhausting. It was such an intense period with a lot of physical training and very little sleep. I don't think anyone can prepare for the sleep deprivation other than just turning up and surviving.\"\nPippa Birch, from Henley, Oxfordshire, was 25 when she first attempted the Royal Marines course in Lympstone, Devon - one of the world's toughest basic military training programmes.\nBut 10 weeks in she broke her leg. Not willing to give up, she returned a year later but had to bow out after 24 weeks.\n\"I had put so many years into it and I felt like I was proving a lot of people right by leaving, but it felt like the right thing to do,\" she said.\nThe Royal Marines is an elite unit, renowned for its ability to operate in extreme environments - going \"where others can't or won't\".\nTo become a Royal Marine Ms Birch would have had to go through 32 weeks of training and complete four commando tests.\nThis includes a nine-mile speed march, an aerial assault course, a time limited cross country obstacle run and a 30-mile march over Dartmoor - all while carrying 21lb (9.5kg) plus a rifle for the tests.\nThe BBC understands there is at least one woman currently in training.\n\"It is just a matter of time before a woman wants to join who can pass,\" Ms Birch said.\nWhile no woman has done this yet, seven women have succeeded at the shorter 13-week All Arms Commando Course – available to serving members of the British military - including Royal Navy officer Lt Lily-Mae Fisher.\nShe is now considered one of the toughest women in the UK armed forces and said: \"It was so much harder than I expected it to be because there's so many more factors to it, sleep deprivation, self-induced pressure, doubt.\"\nIn June 2022, Lt Fisher, who is based in Yeovil, Somerset, proudly put on her green beret, which is worn exclusively by those who pass the commando course, sealing her position as the only current serving female Royal Navy Commando.\n\"It was the best day of my career, if not my life... it's something I am extremely proud of,\" she said.\nLt Fisher echoed Ms Birch when she said \"it is not an impossible task\" for a woman to pass the Royal Marines training.\n\"It will just take the right woman with the right mindset. I don't think it matters about size or shape... it is if you've got the right mental resilience, perseverance, determination, stubbornness,\" she said.\nRoyal Marines training was historically only open to men, but in 2016 a ban on women serving in close combat units in the British militarywas lifted.\nTwo years later, the final hurdle was removed, opening all combat roles to women, includingthe Royal Marines.\nAt the time it was made clear, that this was about equal opportunities. Large numbers of women were not expected to apply.\nFigures obtained by the BBC show that since 2019, 38,229 applications to start Royal Marines training were submitted by men, compared with 924 from women.\nIn the same time period, 4,630 men and just seven women actually started the 32-week training course.\nA spokesperson for the Royal Marines said preparing women for its arduous course was a \"priority\", but no concessions would be made - and the standards, timings and weight-carrying expectations would not be changed for a woman.\n\"The criteria have to be the same for everyone because the frontline doesn't discriminate,\" said former Royal Marine David Coleman, who now trains people who are interested in joining.\nLt Fisher and Ms Birch agreed they do not want to see any concessions made for women.\n\"Standards 100% have to stay the same across the board,\" Lt Fisher said.\nFigures seen by the BBC suggest that in recent years roughly 40% of men who started the training did not complete it.\nAs such, Mr Coleman believes it is just \"a numbers game\" and as more women sign up, they will succeed.\n\"There are a lot more men going for training than women. So, until the numbers rise, I think the pass rate will stay low,\" he said.\n\"Once the first woman does it and everyone realises they could do it too... the flood gates will open.\"\nMs Birch, a club-level rower who now works in security, was the first woman to arrive at the training centre in Lympstone in January 2019.\n\"It sounded amazing,\" she said.\n\"I told my mum I was joining the marines and shaving my hair off.\n\"I thought there was going to be floods of women wanting to join... and I was the only one. I thought this is a bit more intense than I expected.\"\nShe said the experience felt \"isolating\" at times, but the Royal Marines did \"everything they could\" to alleviate that, including providing her with a female mentor.\nShe also struggled to deal with the media attention that came with being the first woman to go through the training.\n\"I had a load of articles written about me, so my face was plastered in these papers getting spread round,\" she said.\n\"It was like living in a goldfish bowl.\"\nMs Birch said the men in her unit \"didn't care\" that she was a woman – but that \"there's very few women that want that job\".\nFor others with their eyes set on working alongside the Royal Marines, members of the Army, Royal Navy or RAF can choose to do the 13-week All Arms Commando Course (AACC).\nThose who are successful earn the green beret and the right to wear \"commando\" insignia but they remain in their respective service – this was the route chosen by Lt Fisher.\nShe is one of seven women to have successfully completed the AACC, with 17 having attempted it.\nTo earn her green beret, Lt Fisher needed to complete the AACC training with the Royal Marines, finishing with the four Commando Tests.\n\"For me it was more mentally demanding than physically because of the pressure I put on myself,\" Lt Fisher said.\n\"My mum had a phone call from me every night usually because I was so worried about the next day.\n\"She just reassured me that what I was doing was so much more than just another military course and that I was paving the way for other girls to come and do this in the future.\"\nIn 2021 the Ministry of Defence announced plans toincrease the number of womenrecruits in the military to 30% by 2030.\nIn a statement the Royal Marines said the \"preparation of women\" prior to them joining either the Royal Marines training or the All Arms Commando Course \"remains a priority\".\n\"We have invested heavily to ensure that information and training is delivered to women before they attend,\" it said.\nIt added it recognised the additional challenges on women and provided tailored support to \"ensure everyone has the best opportunity to pass\".\nLt Fisher has this advice for anyone keen to try: \"Don't be shy, don't hold back and basically just be willing to fail and if you fail then you try again, and again, and again.\"\nFollow BBC News South West onX (formerly Twitter),FacebookandInstagram.

    "tags": "Celtic",
    "text": "I was reminded this week of the legendary retort from the late, great Tommy Gemmell.\nCeltic's rampaging full-back had been asked about the goal he scored in the European Cup final. With a twinkle in his eye, the reply came back quick as a flash: \"Which one?!\"\nIt's oft forgotten the famous 1967 goal with the Lisbon Lions was followed by the opener in the San Siro against Feyenoord three years later.\nIt's the lesser known of the two because the Dutch side came back to win 2-1. Two goals in two European Cup finals. Not bad for a defender, is it?\nWhy was I thinking about this? I'd written a line about Jota, the returning Portuguese wing wizard, describing him as Celtic's '£25m man'.\nThe ghost of Gemmell then prodded me from above: 'Which one?' There are, astonishingly enough, three recent Celtic players who've been sold for around £25m: Jota to Al-Ittihad, Matt O'Riley to Brighton and Kieran Tierney to Arsenal.\nThat is £75m in transfer fees for three players in five years. Two of whom will be back in the hoops before long effectively for nothing, although Celtic did lose Kyogo Furuhashi to Rennes. It is, nonetheless, remarkable business from Celtic plc.\nIt was only around Christmas 2023 that several Celtic fans stood up near us in the media seats furiously waving their wallets at the adjacent club directors. Their beef? The club wasn't being loose enough with the purse strings.\nI would imagine those same board members are feeling pretty good about themselves - and their club - at the moment. Set for another Premiership title. Well fancied for another domestic clean sweep. A money-spinning Champions League play-off against Real Madrid or Bayern Munich to come.\nAll of this with record cash reserves lodged at the bank. The three '£25m men' are complemented by the megabucks departures in recent years of Liel Abada, Josip Juranovic, Jeremie Frimpong, Moussa Dembele, Odsonne Edouard and Kristoffer Ajer. Add Kyogo's fee into that lot and you won't be a kick of the ball away from £80m.\nCeltic were able to spend £26m this season alone on Adam Idah, Arne Engels and Auston Trusty. Jota is back. Tierney is coming back. Those won't be insignificant wages. Which begs the question: Just how far is this new big-spending Celtic board prepared to push the boat out?\nAnother couple of key signings could not only increase the club's ability to deal with their mighty European assignment, it would also greatly enhance Rodgers' hand when it comes to negotiating tricky Champions League qualifiers in the summer.\nKyogo needs replacing and cover is required in defence. If players do arrive, especially for big fees, in what remains of this transfer window, few fans could still quibble about the level of Celtic's spending or the club's ambition.\nJota is back at Celtic 18 months after his £25m departure",

    "text": "Lord Coe set 12 world records during his athletics career\nLord Coe says his pitch to be the first British president of the International Olympic Committee \"seems to have landed well\" with the organisation's members, but \"there's a long road ahead of us\".\nThe head of World Athletics and his six rivals hoping to succeed Thomas Bach gave brief presentations in Lausanne, Switzerland on Thursday.\nThe election takes place in March in Greece.\n\"I hope I was able to communicate my love for the Olympic movement,\" Coe told BBC Sport.\n\"I hope that I was able to get across the purpose and the energy that I think the role requires.\n\"It's not a job, it's a passion, and I hope this is what I can convey over the next few weeks.\"\nBritain's two-time Olympic 1500m champion has vowed to shake up the IOC, pledging to innovate, empower athletes, and introduce \"clear, science-based policies\" to protect the female category amid continuing debate over gender eligibility rules.\nUnder Coe, World Athletics hasbanned transgender womenfrom competing in the female category at international events and toughened the rules over the participation of competitors with differences in sex development (DSD).\nIn his speech, Coe told the 110 IOC members: \"We must never lose sight of what makes the Games special and we are in danger of doing that. Competition must be fair, integrity absolute and sporting excellence non-negotiable.\n\"So we will maintain a laser-like focus on sporting excellence; we will protect and promote the integrity of women's sport, and we will strengthen anti-doping systems, all of which I have done, together with my Council at World Athletics.\"\nWhen asked how he felt his words had been received, Coe said: \"The honest answer to that of course is that you don't know. That's really up to the membership.\n\"I was asking [them] not just to cast a vote for me, but to cast a vote for themselves. A vote of confidence in the skills and the ability and the experience that sits within the IOC, because that in itself is enough to help us navigate those challenges.\n\"The 'holy grail' for any organisation, particularly in sport, is how to excite and maintain the engagement of young people. It's a cluttered landscape. There are many, many distractions and sport needs to figure out how it maintains excitement and interest, particularly Olympic sport.\"\nIOC rules meant candidates were only allowed to speak for fifteen minutes at the closed-doors event, with media barred and no scope for questions from members afterwards.\n\"I'm sure that whoever is successful will want to review a whole series of things,\" said Coe when asked about the lack of transparency in the process.\n\"I think how we choose the leadership of the IOC - in the same way [as] any organisation - will need looking at. And we just need to make sure that we're giving the members ample opportunity to really understand the motivations of people that sit behind those bids, and that can only be personal interaction.\n\"But I've been involved in politics long enough to know that you don't pick a fight with the returning officer on the eve of the election!\"\nCoe faces competition from Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, France's David Lappartient, Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry, Japan's Morinari Watanabe, Swede Johan Eliasch and Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan.",

He was also credited with designing Hamas's signature weapon, the Qassam rocket.\nIn its statement on Thursday, Hamas also announced the death of deputy military commander Marwan Issa.\nThe US announced Issa's death in March last year.\nIssa was the deputy commander of Hamas's military wing and was considered one of Israel's most-wanted men.  The European Union, which placed the Hamas leader on its terrorist blacklist, linked him directly to the 7 October attack.\nThe latest war was triggered when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.\nIsrael's 15-month military offensive killed more than 47,460 Palestinians in the territory, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA ceasefire between Hamas and Israel came into effect on 19 January.\nA total of 15 Israeli hostages have been freed since then.\nSo far, 400 Palestinian prisoners - ranging from those serving long sentences for bombings and other attacks to teenagers held without charge - have been released.\nMost have returned to the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, while about 70 of the most serious offenders have been deported.\nPalestine Action accuses a Buckinghamshire firm of supplying products to aid Israel's military.\nThe Israeli military says it targeted what it describes as \"armed terrorists\" in the town of Tamoun.\nLebanon and the US said the agreement will remain in place until 18 February.\nIt comes as the deadline passes for Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters to withdraw from southern Lebanon.\nThe missile strike on a Lebanese apartment block targeting Hezbollah left mostly civilians dead, BBC finds.",

    "text": "Wales' former children's laureate says he is grateful his mum called the police on him at the age of 16 after he attacked her.\nConnor Allen is a poet, writer and actor and was Children's Laureate Wales from 2021 to 2023, but struggled during his teenage years.\nHe pleaded guilty to assault, battery and grievous bodily harm in court but was given a second chance after an intervention by those closest to him.\nConnor has since turned his life around and is trying to inspire the next generation.\nConnor, who was raised on a council estate in Newport, said the anger had been simmering during his teenage years.\nHis dad was absent from his life and as a mixed-race teenager he often struggled to fit in.\n\"It was just my mum, a single mum, white mum, and my father is black Jamaican. So that absence for me growing up without a father but also without that 'blackness',\" he said.\nHe started getting in trouble with the police and it soon came to a head when he lashed out at his mum.\n\"We were arguing and shouting. My anger erupted on my mum. Obviously there's instant regret, but the action has already been done,\" he said.\nLooking back, Connor is full of admiration for her making that decision.\n\"She didn't know what was going to happen to me when the police took me.\n\"But to have that courage to actually say 'something needs to happen because my son is off the rails,' I always look back at that courage.\"\nNow 32, he still clearly remembers sitting in the courtroom facing his mum.\n\"Even though she was going through all that hurt she still pleaded with the judge,\" he said.\nHis teachers at Lliswerry Comprehensive School had also seen his potential.\nConnor said he feels blessed that they fought for him to have a second chance.\nHe said: \"My mum, the teachers, they wrote a letter to the judge and asked for a suspended sentence. I look back at that period and think if it wasn't for the people who believed in me where would I have been?\"\nConnor said it was \"empowering\" to have that support despite admitting what he did that night was \"horrific\".\n\"To go through all of that and it culminating in you lashing out to have people at your lowest moment they still believe in you... that for me was huge,\" he said.\nHis love of writing came from reading books that his mum would buy him as a child.\nIn particular, the Harry Potter series which allowed him to go into different worlds other than his own.\nHe also took inspiration from the stories told in grime and rap music.\nThat led him to write The Making of a Monster, a grime-theatre mash-up about growing up, working out his place in the world and the danger of a life spiralling out of control.\nConnor is currently writing a sequel Forgiveness of a Monster about finding forgiveness for himself, and his absent father.\n\"I always believe in second chances, If I can give that give of empowerment and belief then who knows what they can go on and achieve,\" he said.\nYou can hear Connor's interview on Books that Made Me with Lucy Owen on BBC Radio Wales at 18:30 GMT on Friday and then onSounds\nCardiff University has £500m in reserves, but says that money cannot be freely spent.\nThe 14-year-old tells a court \"I suppose I'm sorry\" but denies three counts of attempted murder.\nDoctors say they have accepted a revised pay deal from the Welsh government.\nGareth Stephenson, from Aberystwyth, died after a two-car crash on the A470.\nLee Francis says he \"sheds a tear every day\" but is staying positive a year after a serious crash.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The number of new homes in England continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, analysis by BBC Verify suggests.\nThe BBC's housing tracker shows every region of England had a year-on-year fall in new homes in the second half of 2024.\nAbout 107,000 new homes were recorded since last July's election, down 10% on the same six months a year earlier.\nThe latest figures do not yet show the effects of housing targets and planning reforms and the government said work was under way to \"get Britain building again\".\nHowever, experts warn Labour's manifesto target for 1.5 million new homes by the next election will be hard to achieve.\nThe Labour government's targets for English councils, requiring370,000 homes a year,were finalised in December. It expects to see the number of new homes rising \"significantly\" in about 2026-27, once reforms have taken effect.\nThe data analysed by the BBC comes from energy performance certificates (EPCs), a leading indicator of new homes.\nBBC Verify analysis shows the number of EPCs for new homes lodged in the six months to December 2024 fell by 11,800 across England compared with the same period of 2023.\nThe biggest fall was in the North West, down by more than 27% while Yorkshire and The Humber saw a decrease of nearly 15%.\nDecreases in the West Midlands and the North East were slight, at a few dozen homes.\nIt can take on average almost four years from application to building completion, for sites with up to 100 homes, says planning consultancy Lichfields.\nDirector Rachel Clements said the previous Conservative government's changes in 2023, which removed mandatory housing targets, meant developers were less likely to submit an application because of the likelihood of refusal.\n\"This negative housing policy environment has led to a decrease in planning applications submitted, let alone approved, let alone houses built,\" she said.\n\"Labour are rightly trying to turn the dial on this. Time will tell if it can deliver the enormous uplift needed.\"\nThe Conservative party has been approached for comment.\nHousing market analyst Neal Hudson, of BuiltPlace, said there were no easy solutions.\n\"There's been no money forthcoming from government to subsidise delivery by putting homes into the social or private rented sector, which is something that governments did during previous market downturns,\" he said.\nHome Builders Federation chief executive Neil Jefferson said: \"The planning changes are very positive, but were never on their own going to result in an increase in activity and further policy levers will need to be pulled to stimulate supply.\"\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said Labour had inherited \"the worst housing crisis in living memory\".\n\"Work is already under way to get Britain building again, which includes overhauling the broken planning system and restoring mandatory housing targets for councils,\" he said.\n\"We are also increasing government investment in housing to £5 billion for this year, including an extra £500 million for the existing Affordable Homes Programme.\"\nInteractive tool produced by Allison Shultes, Scott Jarvis, Steven Connor, Charlie Colbourne and Preeti Vaghela\nEvery new home, whether a new build or a conversion,must have an EPC by law within five days of construction work being finished. This makes them a leading indicator of new housing in England, although the figures differ from the official statistics on net additional dwellings produced once a year and with an eight-month lag.\nThe main differences are that EPCs do not account for demolitions and may be lodged some time before homes are ready to live in, possibly in a different financial year.\nWe have used EPCs because other quarterly statistics on new housebuilding in Englandtend to be an undercount. The government department in charge of housing has also usedEPCs to estimate numbers of new homeswhile waiting for its annual net additional dwellings statistics to be published.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nA property group has put forward plans for the redevelopment of a brownfield site in Bromyard.\nNew plans for the Laxey Wheel are put forward for approval after criticism of the original design.\nPlans for fields will be up for discussion at a Devon County Council meeting on Wednesday.\nThe former Hexham swimming baths, where the bottle was discovered, is being converted into flats.\nAshcourt Group, behind the Hull proposal, say hundreds of jobs would be created and congestion cut.",

    "text": "West Ham boss Graham Potter has been speaking to the media before Monday's Premier League game againstChelsea(kick-off 20:00 GMT).\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\nOn the Hammers' efforts to sign players in January: \"The club, the board and the chairman have been fantastic and really supportive. They've been wanting to help and, if anything, it's me and us trying to find the right player.\"\nPotter added: \"I want to make the right decisions for this football club and the right player for this team. Signing a player is easy - there are so many agents pushing players left, right and centre. But the right one for the right price who fits how you want to play and fits into the group? That's the difficult thing. As a club, we have to be mindful of that.\"\nAsked whether he is being 'picky' about potential new signings, Potter said: \"Maybe I'm picky in that I believe in the team and the club, more so than names plucked out of a hat or thrown around in the media. I believe our fans want a team fighting for each other and that's going in the same direction. So therefore my 'pickiness' is just to make sure we get people who want to buy into that.\"\nPotter said he will not speak about links to specific players and added he \"feels for supporters\" regarding constant transfer speculation: \"Apologies if I'm not going to confirm or deny [links to players] but it's my stance that I don't want to speak about players that aren't at West Ham.\"\nOn the logistics of playing a match on the same day as the transfer deadline: \"It doesn't change anything from my perspective. We just prepare for the game and focus on the players we have. We'll work behind the scenes to do what we think is right.\"\nIt will be Potter's first game against Chelsea since his departure from Stamford Bridge in 2023: \"I had some good times and special nights there. I wish them well as a club, I'm thankful to them because it was part of my journey. But I'm here now - I'm delighted with that. I'm looking forward to seeing some friends and playing the game.\"\nOn what he expects from Chelsea: \"They are a tactically well-prepared team, Enzo [Maresca] has done a great job with that, and they've done a great job as a club in terms of stabilising and rejuvenating the squad. It's a tough game - they're competing to be in the Champions League. We have to play to the strengths we have and we go there with optimism, encouragement and enthusiasm.\"\nFollow all of Thursday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "text": "A \"coward\" who repeatedly bit and beat his girlfriend during a terrifying attack has been jailed.\nBrandon Holding, 25, also suffocated and stamped on the woman during the half hour ordeal in May last year, Newcastle Crown Court heard.\nThe woman, who was left with multiple injuries, said she feared she was going to be killed and had been left traumatised.\nHolding, of Shafto Street in Newcastle, admitted causing grievous bodily harm and was jailed for two years and four months.\nHolding and the woman had known each other since school and had been in a relationship for two years, prosecutor Joe Culley said.\nIt was a \"volatile\" partnership with Holding being abusive and jealous, especially when drunk, the court heard.\nHe returned home from a night out in Newcastle at about 04:00 BST on 21 May and found his partner using her phone, the court was told.\nHolding flew into a rage and attacked her in their bedroom, repeatedly whipping her with a dog lead before biting her on her face and body and raining down punches and stamps.\nAt one point he suffocated her causing her to black out, the court heard.\nMr Culley said Holding was in \"full attack mode\" and the woman said she was \"terrified [Holding] would kill her\".\nAfter about half an hour she was able to flee barefoot into the street from where she called police.\nThe woman was taken to hospital and treated for multiple bite marks across her body including on her lips, two black eyes, a broken knuckle on her little finger and extensive swelling and bruising to her face, the court heard.\nIn a statement read to the court, the woman said she was \"traumatised\" and did not think she would \"ever get over it\".\nShe said she had \"never felt hated so much\" by somebody, especially someone who was supposed to care for her.\nThe woman said she felt unable to leave her house and suffered flashbacks and nightmares.\nRecorder Nicholas Lumley KC said the couple had an \"unhappy\" history of violence fuelled by Holding's jealousy and alcohol use, adding the \"poor girl\" had \"done nothing wrong\".\n\"It's very difficult to see how she could quickly or even ever get over what you did to her,\" the judge said, adding Holding's \"no comment\" answers in his police interview were \"cowardly\".\nA restraining order lasting 10 years was also made banning Holding, who has a history of convictions for violence, from contacting the woman.\nFollow BBC North East onX,Facebook,NextdoorandInstagram.

We found widespread shortfalls in its overall management.\"\nInspectors also found that consent was not appropriately obtained or documented prior to administering vaccinations to some vulnerable people, and that vaccinations were not always given by authorised staff.\nMs Coleman added: \"People reported difficulties contacting the practice on the telephone and using their website.\n\"Staff couldn't prioritise people according to the most urgent need because they didn't have access to the appropriate tools.

    "text": "Luke Williams' Swansea are in need of reinforcements having taken only one point from their past five league games\nSwansea City are aiming to complete a number of deals before Monday's transfer deadline as they bid to bolster Luke Williams' squad for the remainder of the Championship season.\nSwansea are targeting the Premier League loan market as they chase at least one midfielder to replace Coventry City-bound Matt Grimes, while Peterborough'sHector Kyprianou is on their list of targets.\nThe Championship club are also in the market for a wide player and an attacking midfielder, as has been the case throughout the January window.\nSwansea areclose to finalising a move for Melker Widell,though the Swedish Under-21 international will return to current club AaB Aalborg on loan for the rest of the Danish top-flight campaign as part of that deal.\nWilliams says he hopes Harry Darling will remain at the Swansea.com Stadium until the summer, at least, despite speculation linking the centre-back with Sheffield United.\nSwansea would be left reeling should another of their key players depart having seenclub skipper Grimes tempted away by Coventry.\nThe Sky Blues move came as a surprise to Swansea who, as a result, believe the loan market is their only option to replace Grimes during this window.\nThey are looking at options in the top flight, with the removal of Grimes' salary from the wage bill – he was Swansea's top earner – meaning they have the option of moving for a more established Premier League player rather than an inexperienced youngster.\nSwans 'move on' as Cabango replaces Grimes as captain\nSwans boss Williams condemns 'unsettling' death threats\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\nIt may be that Swansea look to sign for two central midfielders, such was Grimes' influence – and contribution in terms of playing minutes – under Williams.\nThe urgent need to fill the gap means Swansea look set for a hectic end to the transfer window, given that they were already in the market for two players – either on permanent or loan deals - as well as Widell.\n\"I can't give you names at the moment but we are looking at players in several positions,\" Williams said ahead of Saturday's Championship meeting with Coventry.\n\"Obviously there's a new drive now because it was quite a quick transaction [for Grimes], so we have had to react sharply to try to find out what's out there that could come in and help us in that department.\n\"It's challenging, of course it's challenging because it's a very competitive market place, but we are doing everything we can. We want to try to raise the bar and bring in talented players who can push the level.\"\nSwansea have been linked with a string of players this month, but their only signing so far is Hannes Delcroix, the central defender who arrived on loan from Burnley last week.\nHannes Delcroix will make his home debut against Coventry City on Saturday\nGrimes will join fellow midfielder Azeem Abdulai, defender Nelson Abbey – who was recalled from his loan spell by Olympiakos - and goalkeepers Andy Fisher and Nathan Broome in leaving the club this month.\nWilliams is relatively confident Darling will not join the list of mid-season departures even though Swansea face losing him for nothing when his contract expires in the summer.\nDarling, who has so far declined to sign the new deal on offer, has been linked with a move to the Blades, while he is also understood to be a long-term target for Bristol City and Birmingham City.\n\"A player of Harry's quality, of course there's going to be speculation all the time,\" Williams said.\n\"But to my knowledge there's been no contact from anyone so as far as I'm concerned, Harry stays with us until at least the end of the season.\"",

It finally happened and it's like a dream come true.\"\nOn her playing style and what fans can expect: \"Hopefully we can see a team that wants to have the ball, that has clear intentions with the ball, to score as many goals as possible and when we don't have the ball to press as aggressive and as high as possible.\"",

The investigation will help us understand that – was the Black Hawk too high? Was it on course? Right now we don’t quite know,” Hegseth adds.\nHe says this is speculation, and the investigation will reveal more - adding that the black boxes from the helicopter have yet to be recovered.\nInvestigators haverecovered the flight data recorders, known as black boxes, from the wreckage of the passenger plane, with a preliminary report into the crash set to be issued in 30 days.\nOfficials have now resumed their recovery operation at the site of the crash, as this footage shows.\nDivers were forced to pause their search and recovery efforts in the Potomac River on Thursday due to dangerous conditions in the water.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Recovery resumes at Washington DC crash site on Friday\nStav DanaosLead weather presenter\nWeather conditions remain unfavourable for search and rescue in the area today.\nAn active weather system continues to move through the region with overcast skies bringing persistent, and at times, heavy rain.\nWinds will be fresh to strong throughout the day. Temperatures will be milder today, compared to recent days, with highs of around 14C (57F), although it won't feel mild with the cloud, breeze and rain.\nAfter the recent very cold snap across the central and eastern USA, the waters of the River Potomac remain very cold, with average water temperatures at the crash site hovering around 2 degrees (37F).\nConditions improve into the weekend across the DC area, with drier and sunnier weather forecast – although it will turn chiller again with day maxes of 9 or 10C (48 to 50F) and chilly nights, with perhaps a touch of frost.\nAs Washington DC faces another day, the wreckages of the plan and helicopter involved in the collision lay in the water, underneath the flight path of Ronald Reagan Washington National airport:\nA photo from earlier this morning shows a Police boat guarding the crash site on the Potomac River\nPresident Trump has taken to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to claim that the Black Hawk helicopter involved in Wednesday's deadly crash was \"flying too high, by a lot\".\n\"The Black Hawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???,\" Trump writes.\nAs a reminder, an investigation into what led to the crash is currently under way, with a preliminary report expected to be released within the next 30 days.\nInvestigations are ongoing into the cause of the fatal crash which saw a collision between a passenger plane and a Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River in Washington DC.\nThe helicopter appears to have been flying above the permitted altitude, according to analysis by the BBC's US partner CBS News.\nRecordings of air traffic control conversations published online suggest a controller tried to warn the helicopter about the American Airlines plane in the seconds before the collision.\nAmerican Airlines has told the BBC that flights running from Wichita, Kansas to Washington DC are set to resume today.\nFlight number AA5677 operates six times a week, a spokesperson for the airline said.\nMeanwhile, the Reagan National Airport - close to where the collision happened and the destination of the passenger plane - is \"operating normally, including all customer services\", the airport says.\nAn American Airlines flight to Miami set off from the airport ahead of schedule early this morning, with further departures currently expected to run on time.\nAs we've been reporting, a passenger plane and a Black Hawk helicopter were involved in a crash on Wednesday night.\nThe CRJ-700 plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew. The aircraft is a twin engine, medium range jet, Sky Brary says on its website.\nThe passenger plane is 106ft 1in (32.3m) long, more than double the 50ft 1in (15.27m) US army helicopter.\nThere were three soldiers on board the helicopter.\nAdam GoldsmithLive reporter\nIt’s lunchtime in the UK, and as Washington DC braces for another day of recovery efforts on the Potomac River, here's a look back at what you need to know.\nInvestigators have recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, known as black boxes, from the American Airlines plane. The recorders will be analysed at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) lab, nearby the site of the crash, according to CBS.\nMultiple factors are being considered in the investigation, officials say, as media reports suggest that one air traffic controller was doing the work of two people at the time of the crash.\nThe names of some of the 67 victims killed in the fatal crash are being released.Including crew members and passengers on the plane, and two of the three crew on board the US army helicopter.\nOvernight, recovery efforts were paused due to \"difficult conditions\" as DC’s emergency services say they expect to work with NTSB to \"conduct additional searches and begin operations to salvage the aircraft\".\nWeather conditions are not expected to be particularly favourable today, BBC Weather's Sarah Keith-Lucas reports.\nWe'll continue to bring you the latest updates and analysis from our teams in London and Washington DC, stay with us.\nVictoria Park-FroudBBC News\nI've been speaking with Mo Khimji, a pilot who regularly flies in and out of Reagan National Airport.\nHe says the airport and surrounding airspace are extremely congested and that even with all the superb training pilots receive, this exposes vulnerabilities.\n“If we are landing on the river and we have a strong right to left crosswind, we have to be cognizant of it. A late turn can result in that wind pushing us into the restricted airspace by a whisker,\" Mo tells me.\n“There are times when we are watching planes land and we find ourselves saying 'whoa that is close'.\n\"Having said that air traffic control does an exemplary job. This was an absolute tragedy and could have been avoided,\" he adds.\nSarah Keith-LucasWeather presenter\nWeather conditions are currently chilly, damp and breezy in\nWashington. Over recent hours, the southerly wind has been picking up, and at\n2am local time was around 11mph.\nLight rain has started falling, and\ntemperatures are around 6C and will continue to fall over the next few hours.\nThe forecast into Friday is not looking particularly\nfavourable. There will be some fairly persistent rain accompanied with\nmoderate south-westerly winds.\nIt will turn milder though, with air\ntemperatures reaching around 14C by the afternoon.\nLooking ahead to the weekend, things will turn cooler but\nalso drier and brighter as high pressure builds in from the west. Highs will\nreach around 9 or 10C  by day, but ice and frost are likely on Saturday\nnight though as temperatures fall to around -2C.\nRescue teams are facing \"terrible conditions\" in the recovery operation at the Potomac River, a former US Coast Guard member has said.\nShannon Scaff, a senior risk consultant, says rescue teams are working in \"low to zero visibility\" and have the currents of the river and the fuselage of the aircraft to contend with. They're also operating in \"cumbersome\" suits to protect them from the cold, he adds.\n\"The deck is stacked against them,\" Scaff says.\nCoast Guard teams searched the Potomac River yesterday\nTurning attention back to the investigation now, it's just turned 06:45 in Washington DC and daylight is emerging onto the site of the fatal plane crash, where we're expecting recovery operations to resume.\nThe city's fire and emergency department says: \"Divers will work with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to conduct additional searches to locate aircraft components, to support the investigation, and begin operations to salvage the aircraft.\"\nNo survivors are expected to be recovered from the Potomac River, and thenames of some of the victimsof the crash are slowly being released.\nStick with us as we bring you updates on the recovery efforts and the search for answers.\nSenator Roger Marshall issued a joint statement with Ron Estes yesterday\nAs the names of some of the 67 people killed in the fatal crash are slowly emerging, US politicians are paying tribute to members of their communities who lost their lives.\nGovernor ofRhode IslandDan McKee says the state's \"heart breaks for their devastating loss\", after figure skater Spencer Lane, 16, and his mother Christine Lane were killed.\nVirginiaGovernor Glenn Youngkin says that he’s learned “Virginia families were among those lost”, but has not identified the victims himself.\nIn Wichita,Kansas, where the flight to Washington DC departed, US Senators Ron Estes and Roger Marshall issued a joint statement.\nThey say \"it’s likely that many of us directly or indirectly know people who were on Flight 5342\", adding that it is a \"sad day for Kansans and our nation\".\n\"This community - steeped in aviation and manufacturing history - will feel the pain of this catastrophe for years to come.”\nAt least 14 figure skaters were on board the passenger plane that collided with a US army helicopter on Wednesday - here's some more detail on them.\nSpencer Lane, 16, and his motherChristine Lane, were both on the flight. Spencer's father Douglas tells local media his son was \"a force of nature\" who showed \"drive and tenacity\" to the sport.\nJinna Han, 13, and her motherJin Hanare also confirmed to have died in the crash.\nEvgenia ShishkovaandVadim Naumov,Russian ice skating coaches were also killed in the crash, the Kremlin confirmed.

Scroll down to watch the highlights and read all the reaction following the close of play.\nHas Ffion Wynne held back in her match report? Not a bit of it. Make sure you read that before you leave this page and go about your day.\nWe will of course be back at 03:15 GMT on Saturday with live text commentary and ball-by-ball coverage from the Test Match Special team for day two.\nBetween now and then here's some stories which might be of interest:\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Sutherland hits first Women's ton at the MCG\nAustralia all-rounder Annabel Sutherland on her century:\"It was pretty special. To have a Test match here at the G, have a good time and score some runs, it’s pretty special. I got to do it in front of family and friends.\n\"I love batting. Anytime I get a chance I try and cash in. I know how important it is to get ahead in the game. We’ve kept them out there and we’ll try to get as far ahead as we can.\"\nOn Australia's position:\"I think we were pretty keen to get more of a lead. Ideally we'll only bat once and look to take 10 as fast as we can.\"\nOn Beth Mooney:\"She’s pretty chill, she’ll rock up five minutes before the warm-up and hopefully tick it over to three figures.\"\nOn the conditions:\"There was still a bit in it. They [England] bowled well in patches. In the morning, they created a lot of chances but couldn't convert them.\"\nEngland fast bowler Lauren Fileron England's performance:\"We're happy with how we bowled. We attacked them and they were patient, fair play to them. We'll just go again tomorrow. We don't want to be a team that gives up. We want to keep pushing and fighting to better ourselves on the pitch and as people.\"\nOn talk about the team:\"It's not been the tour we wanted. We all know we're better than this, we don't need reminding. There's messages going on, it's hard to hear but we understand that we haven't performed the way we wanted to. Hopefully over the next few days we can show what we're made of.\"\nOn the dropped catches:\"We know we need to work on some stuff in the field. We're all human. Dropped catches do happen, probably more often than we'd like but we can work on it tomorrow.\"\nOn training:\"We work really hard to test ourselves. In a game, it's a completely different scenario, there's an additional pressure. It's [catches] something we need to get better at. It's hard to replicate it in training.\"\nOn the MCG:\"I'm pleasantly surprised about the crowd. The birds have surprised me the most. It's an amazing stadium and a great place to play cricket.\"\nDespite how the scorecard appears England's bowling at times was actually pretty good. The intelligence, skill and persistence from Lauren Bell to get the wicket of Phoebe Litchfield was a case in point. She built pressure over the course of a few overs and got her reward.\nEqually, Sophie Ecclestone's marathon efforts with the ball deserved more than just the wickets of Alyssa Healy and Ash Gardner.\nThis video can not be played\n'Fantastic' Bell removes Litchfield for 45\nThis video can not be played\nHealy unhappy as Ecclestone takes wicket despite Australia review\nEngland bowler Ryana MacDonald-Gay, speaking to TNT Sports:\"I am really happy with how it went today [getting that first Ashes wicket] because Annabel Sutherland batted really well. So to get her wicket was pretty amazing.\n\"The message [from England captain Heather Knight] was to just bowl line and length, hit the stumps, and try to do that for as long as I can.\n\"With the bat yesterday it was hard. They have some really good bowlers but I found the longer I was out there the easier it was. They were quite on it at the start and the longer we kept them out there the more they wore down a bit more.\"\nOn making her Ashes debut:\"I was nervous but I'm very competitive and don't want to be shown up by anyone else, That's where the grit and determination comes from.\"\nOn dropped catches costing England:\"That was unfortunate but we have to keep moving on. Australia have some good batters, and still have some good batters to come.\n\"The only way to keep going was to forget about it and keep buzzing around. The pitch is playing okay, and there's a bit in it for the batters and a bit for the bowlers.\"\nEngland's fielding woes did not just extend to Annabel Sutherland, though.\nThey dropped seven bona fide catches, and missed a few other chances you suspect the Aussies might have caught.\nOn top of that were a few sloppy misfields and a lack of intensity to build pressure at times.\nThis video can not be played\n'Goodness me!' - England drop seven catches\nFrom an Australian perspective it's been a day dominated by Annabel Sutherland after the all-rounder, who resumed the day on 24, went on to hit 163 off 258 balls. Her third Test century.\nShe was dropped by England twice early in her innings - a relatively straightforward chance for Danni Wyatt-Hodge and a much tougher one for wicketkeeper Amy Jones - with Sophie Ecclestone the bowler on both occasions.\nRyana MacDonald-Gay eventually got her wicket, but the damage was done by that point.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Sutherland hits first Women's ton at the MCG\nThis video can not be played\nSutherland departs for 163\nMark RobinsonWarwickshire first-team coach on TNT Sports\nDo England look psychologically gone in the field? Yes, they do. It's been infectious hasn't it? One goes down, confidence goes and people don't really want the ball.\nThey had spells in the game where it got embarrassing and it was a hard watch. The headlines will be about the catching and fielding and quite rightly so. I thought they did actually do some things well.\nI think Heather Knight has had a good game as captain which looks and sounds ridiculous when you see the scorecard. The bowlers have delivered to a large extent.\nGeorgia ElwissEngland all-rounder on TNT Sports\nWas this arguably England's worst day of the Women's Ashes? I think so.\nFrom my point of view, the position they came into this Test match they wanted to show heart, fight and give a good account of themselves.\nUnfortunately, today, they have shown anything but that, especially in the field. The bowlers did well in the morning, stuck at it, and created chances but fielders let them down.\nCatches an international side should take have gone down and Australia made England pay.\n#bbccricket, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (standard network charges apply)\nI hope England are not going to blame the seagulls for seven dropped catches today.\nHarry, London\nMichelle GoszkoEx-Australia batter on BBC Sounds\nWe saw an epic innings from Annabel Sutherland. There's been some good contributions from Phoebe Litchfield and Alyssa Healy as well. Hopefully Beth Mooney can get two more runs tomorrow to take her up to a century.\nMooney 98, McGrath 9\nThe crowd aren't happy but Beth Mooney is all smiles - OK, there might have been a hint of a grimace, too - as she walks off unbeaten on 98.\nA day of utter Australian dominance. Annabel Sutherland led the way with a magnificent 163 before Mooney took over later in the day.\nAs for England, well, catching practice is in order after they shelled seven in the day, including Sutherland twice in the 30s and three when Mooney had very few.\nAustralia lead by 252 runs and 16-0 is looking pretty good from here.\nLead by 252\nTahlia McGrath does get a single but Beth Mooney only manages one from the next.\nMcGrath then hits over extra cover and there are boos from the crowd as they come back for two.\nNo single fifth ball and that brings more boos from the crowd. There will be no ton for Mooney tonight.\nLead by 248\nJust a single first ball for Beth Mooney. Can Tahlia McGrath get Mooney back on strike?\nHeather Knight is coming on to bowl her off-spin, looking to tempt Beth Mooney perhaps?\nLead by 247\nBeth Mooney takes two from the first ball of the over then calls for a quick single.\nIt would have been very tight and Tahlia McGrath might have been in trouble had Nat Sciver-Brunt managed to gather the ball cleanly at mid-wicket.\nTime for one more over before stumps. Mooney is on 96.\nMichelle GoszkoEx-Australia batter on BBC Sounds\nEngland have only employed five bowlers all day. They haven't really tried anything different here.\nLead by 244\nLauren Filer is going to the short stuff late in the day and changes the angle to round the wicket to Tahlia McGrath.\nJust a single from that one.\nBeth Mooney will be on strike to start the next, she needs seven for a maiden Test hundred. With just five minutes left in the day, will she get there tonight?\nMichelle GoszkoEx-Australia batter on BBC Sounds\nIt's been a Katy Perry kind of day for England in the field, hot and cold.\nHenry MoeranTest Match Special commentator\nEngland have been dreadful from the field but Australia have been far from perfect.\nTo watch and listen, you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nAustralia v England - Test Match, Day 2.

They expect them to go out there, throw the ball around, score tries and entertain everyone.\n\"Sometimes teams can go and overplay, particularly early on, try things and make mistakes and this gives you opportunities.\"\nHow to follow 2025 Six Nations across the BBC\nAre we in the golden era of the Six Nations?\nAntoine Dupont returns from his sevens exploits to skipper the side and he partners Romain Ntamack at half-back – it's Ntamack's first cap for 17 months after recovering from a serious knee injury.\nWing Damian Penaud is out with a muscle issue and is replaced by Theo Attissogbe. Jonathan Danty, Gael Fickou, Thibaud Flament Anthony Jelonch, Charles Ollivon and Reda Wardi are all absent and there's no place for fly-half Matthieu Jalibert in the matchday 23.\nFrance line-up:15-Ramos; 14-Attissogbe, 13-Barassi, 12-Moefana, 11-Bielle-Biarrey; 10-Ntamack, 9-Dupont (capt); 1-Gros, 2-Mauvaka, 3-Atonio, 4-Roumat, 5-Meafou, 6-Cros, 7-Boudehent, 8-Alldritt.\nReplacements:16-Marchand, 17-Baille, 18-Colombe, 19-Auradou, 20-Guillard, 21-Jegou, 22-Le Garrec, 23-Gailleton.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nFit-again Ntamack returns for France against Wales\nExperienced backs Josh Adams and Liam Williams are in but veteran back row Taulupe Faletau is not in the squad.\nEvan Lloyd and Henry Thomas earn their first starts in the front row, while Dafydd Jenkins, the 2024 Six Nations captain, is at lock.

They also have an astonishing amount of power and weight in the pack which Wales have to try and live with.\nBut it's not a bad-looking Welsh side. Their back-row of James Botham, Jac Morgan and Aaron Wainwright should compete well, Tomos Williams is in great form at scrum-half and the experience of Josh Adams and Liam Williams in the back-field will be vital to give them hope here and for the rest of the championship.\nWales' whole focus cannot be on Dupont - Gatland\nSix Nations: Captains special\nSix Nations to use 20-minute red cards for first time\nHead-to-head\nFrance have won six successive Test matches against Wales.\nHowever, the Welsh have won five of their 12 Six Nations Tests in France; no other team has won as often on French soil.\nFrance\nFrance have won the Six Nations once since 2010, securing the Grand Slam in 2022.\nThey won only one of their three Six Nations Tests at home last year, drawing one and losing the other.\nThomas Ramos kicked more goals (25) and scored more points (63) than any other Six Nations player in 2024.\nWales\nWales have lost 12 consecutive Tests, which is their worst ever run.\nThey lost all five of their Six Nations matches in 2024 and went on to claim the Wooden Spoon.\nWales could lose seven successive Six Nations games for the first time in 22 years.\nWarren Gatland will take charge of 150th Test as Wales head coach in Paris.\nThis video can not be played\nHow does the Six Nations scoring work?\nThis video can not be played\nDrama, despair & smelly socks - pundits relive Six Nations days",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Germany's parliament descended into heckles and recriminations on Wednesday after a \"firewall\" against working with the far-right cracked.\nA non-binding motion calling for tougher border and asylum rules passed with support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). During the stormy session, politicians of various parties hurled criticism and blame at each other.\nConservative CDU leader Friedrich Merz, who tabled the plans, defended his actions as \"necessary\". But Chancellor Olaf Scholz slammed the move as an \"unforgivable mistake\".\nMerz now plans to propose actual legislation on Friday – again with possible AfD backing – aimed at curbing immigration numbers and family reunion rights.\nBut his proposed measures are highly unlikely to come into effect this side of February's snap election and – if they did – could clash with EU law.\nReferring to the AfD's support for the motion, the CDU leader told the Bundestag that a policy wasn't wrong just because the \"wrong people back it\".\n\"How many more children have to become victims of such acts of violence before you also believe there is a threat to public safety and order?\" he asked.\nThe CDU leader – tipped to be Germany's next chancellor because of his party's leading position in the polls – has also insisted he has neither sought nor wants AfD support.\n\"Thinking about how the AfD fraction will cheer and their happy faces makes me feel uncomfortable,\" he told lawmakers.\nChancellor Scholz – a social democrat whose coalition government collapsed last year – castigated Merz for his actions.\n\"Since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany over 75 years ago, there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats in our parliaments: we do not make common cause with the far right.\"\nGermany's already fraught debate on immigration has flared up following a series of fatal attacks where the suspect is an asylum-seeker, most recently in the city of Aschaffenburg.\nIt has become a central issue in campaigning for the election, triggered by the collapse of Scholz's governing coalition.\nWednesday's CDU motion, supported by the AfD and liberal FDP, called for a \"ban\" on anyone entering Germany without the right documents – but it cannot compel the current minority government to act.\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of the firewall against the far-right in German political culture. Remembrance of the Holocaust plays a fundamental role in modern Germany.\nBefore Wednesday's vote, the Bundestag held its yearly commemoration for the victims of the Nazis, during which 88-year-old Holocaust survivor Roman Schwarzmann addressed parliament.\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also delivered a speech to MPs, calling for the Nazis' crimes never to be forgotten. There should be no \"line drawn\" ending our historical responsibility as Germans, he said.\nThis directly contradicts the policy of the AfD, which has criticised German memory culture and argued for a broader view of the country's history.\nThat's partly why so many were shocked when Friedrich Merz said last week that he didn't care if the AfD supported his parliamentary motions or not.\nThis contradicts not only his previous statements, but also the official line of his party, which bans the conservatives from relying on the far-right in parliamentary votes.\nSections of the AfD have been classed as right-wing extremists by domestic intelligence, but the party is currently polling second, although Merz has ruled out any kind of coalition with them.\nThis week, latest polls showed that support for the conservative CDU had slipped a couple of percentage points to 28%, while the AfD increased slightly to 20%.\nAfD leader Alice Weidel has said the firewall amounts to an \"anti-democratic cartel agreement\" and has predicted it will crumble over the coming years.\nOpening the door to leaning on support from the far-right is a gamble for Merz, who believes that his increasingly radical stance on migration will win back right-wingers who are tempted to vote for the AfD.\nBut in so doing, he could risk losing support from the centre.\nWith these latest parliamentary motions, Merz has definitively said goodbye to the era of his more centrist conservative predecessor Angela Merkel, who a decade ago famously said \"wir schaffen das\" or \"we can do it\" when Germany was faced with large numbers of migrants and refugees.\nThese motions are symbolic, signalling what the conservatives would like to do in power. But they are also a concrete signal to voters about who Merz appears prepared to accept support from.\nCritics say he has broken his word on the firewall. No wonder the AfD cheered in parliament when the result was announced.\nFriedrich Merz says he will close Germany's borders to irregular migrants, including those with a right to protection.\nThe world's richest man takes his endorsement of Germany's far-right party to a new level.\nThe EU's two leading members were reacting to the US president-elect's plans to acquire Denmark's autonomous territory.\nAlthough some of Europe's leaders have found favour with the billionaire, others are worried by his interventions.\nDespite losing, the result was the outcome the SDP leader wanted and paves the way for early elections.",

    "text": "An itch can sometimes be caused by an allergic reaction or a bug bite\nSometimes a certain feeling can get under our skin - when we need to scratch an itch, especially if we've been bitten by a bug!\nBut why does it feel so good when it can cause our skin to look red and sore?\nScientists at the University of Pittsburgh in the US have been studying what drives this itchy cycle.\nThey've discovered that while it's not great for our skin, there are also some benefits to scratching, which have been published in the journal Science.\nWhy do we itch and is there a way to stop it?\nWhat is eczema?\nSkincare: Children 'using creams not intended for their age'\nIt's not just us - animals like to scratch an itch too!\nThe research discovered that scratching made inflammation worse, and aggravated the skin, which explains why it goes red afterwards.\nInflammation is when our bodies release chemicals to fight off infections which can help healing. It can cause swelling and redness.\nThe study says having a scratch triggers our immune systems and activates things called mast cells.\nThese drive more itching, which leads to more inflammation. And so the cycle continues.\nScientists have been looking at why that scratchy feeling can takeover\nSenior author Daniel Kaplan said: \"Scratching is often pleasurable, which suggests that, in order to have evolved, this behaviour must provide some kind of benefit.\"\nAnd now they think they've found that benefit, as researchers discovered the mast cells also improve the skin's defence against a bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus, which is the most common bacteria involved in skin infections.\nThe cells also protect against other bacterias and germs.\nThe team is now looking into how this info may be able to help people with certain skin conditions.\nIvory ban extended to protect hippos and some whales\nChildren break world record for Largest Poetry Lesson\nCaught on camera: the 'remarkable' species recorded in Cambodia for the first time\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Sri Lanka is set to relax a ban on some vehicle imports in a sign the country is returning to normal after a severe economic crisis that toppled a president.\nFrom 1 February, imports of buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed to resume, while restrictions on other vehicles are expected to be gradually lifted.\nMany Sri Lankans are waiting for authorities to also drop an import ban on private cars, sport utility vehicles and three-wheeled trishaws - which are commonly used as taxis.\nBut with prices of vehicles forced up by a scarcity of new ones to buy,  a weak currency and high taxes, some are asking who will be able to afford a new car.\nIn 2022, Sri Lanka faced a severe foreign currency shortage, which meant it was unable to meet its obligations to creditors for the first time in its history.\nThe island nation of 22 million people was thrown into turmoil as it faced crippling shortages of fuel, food and medicines.\nMassive anti-government protests toppled then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa just months later.\nColombo negotiated a $2.9bn (£2.3bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund, while Rajapaksa's successor introduced austerity measures including hiking taxes and ending energy subsidies.\nThe country's finances have since improved and the economy is gradually returning from the brink.\nThe announcement to lift the import ban on vehicles has triggered a buzz among Sri Lankans who have been waiting for years to buy a new car or a van.\nMurtaza Jafeerjee, chair of Advocata, an economic think tank based in Colombo, told the BBC he thought the move was long overdue.\n\"The vehicle imports will not only increase the government's revenue but will also trigger other economic activities like car financing, dealer revenue, car servicing and other related activities, creating jobs,\" he said.\nBut Nalinda Jayatissa, the country's information minister told a media briefing on Tuesday that the country was \"moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves\".\nThe country, which doesn't have any major factories producing cars and trucks, imports almost all its vehicles, many of them from countries like Japan and India. Now there's a also lot of interest in Chinese cars, particularly electric vehicles.\nPrices of used cars in Sri Lanka have soared, with some models now costing two or three times as much as they did before the ban.\nThe restrictions have been particularly difficult for people like Gayan Indika, who provides vehicles for weddings and is a part-time cab driver.\n\"I want to buy a new car so that I can do my work and resume my private cab rental. Without a car, without mobility, I am losing a lot of my revenue,\" he said.\nIn a country with poor public transport, a car can be vital, Sasikumar, a software professional from the central city of Kandy explained.\n\"As we don't have a good public transport system, a car is essential to travel to other parts of the country. Either the government should lift the ban on cars or improve the public transport.\"\nSri Lanka imported about $1.4bn worth of vehicles in the year before the ban was imposed. This year the central bank says it's planning to allocate up to a billion dollars for vehicle imports, but said the money will be released gradually.\nArosha Rodrigo, from the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka, and his family have been running a car dealership for more than four decades.\nThe firm was importing about 100 vehicles a month before the ban. Since the restrictions came into force they have not been unable to import a single vehicle.\nHe points out that even if the ban is relaxed further, to allow passenger cars and other vehicles to be imported, many people won't be able to afford them because of increased taxes and Sri Lanka's weak currency.\nThe government has sharply raised excise duties on imported vehicles, both new and second hand, to 200% and 300% depending on engine size.\nOn top of excise duty, there is also 18% Value Added Tax (VAT) for any vehicle brought from abroad.\nThe price of imported vehicles will also be impacted by the weakness of the Sri Lankan rupee against major world currencies like the US dollar.\nThose soaring costs are putting off people like school teacher R Yasodha.\n\"We have been waiting to purchase a vehicle for a long time. But if we calculate the tax and the price, the cost of an average sized car has doubled from 2.5 million rupees ($8,450; £6,800) to five million rupees,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It would cost a fortune for us.\"\nRain slows Australia's progress on day three of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle as only two wickets fall.\nUsman Khawaja's maiden double century and a hundred on debut from Josh Inglis give Australia complete control of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax revenue - hit its highest December level for four years.\nThe government gets most of its money from tax but also borrows when it wants to boost spending.\nNorthern Ireland's economy grew strongly in the third quarter of 2024, the latest official data suggests.",

    "text": "An interior designer and her hockey coach husband were living \"almost separate lives\" before he allegedly stabbed her to death at their home, a court has heard.\nEgyptian national Mohamed Samak, 42, denies murdering his 49-year-old wife Joanne Samak on 1 July 2024.\nMrs Samak's mother, Penelope Vale, told Worcester Crown Court the couple, who lived with her, slept in separate rooms and that Mr Samak would often work away.\nThe court was also told that Mr Samak was \"unhappy\" with their relationship.\nAt the opening of the trial on Tuesday, the jury heard that Mr Samak claimed his wife was suffering with mental health and alcohol issues.\nHe claimed she had stabbed herself \"repeatedly\" before he found her slumped on a bed with a knife in her stomach at their home in Chestnut Spinney, Droitwich Spa.\nBut the prosecution said he killed her after becoming interested in another woman and experiencing financial difficulties.\nMrs Vale told the court Mr Samak would spend several evenings a week and weekends playing and coaching hockey.\nMeanwhile Mrs Samak, who was the main breadwinner, would go to bed at about 20:00 as she would often wake at 05:00 for work and her job involved a lot of driving, so she did not see her husband much.\nMrs Vale said Mr Samak would \"complain occasionally\" that he and his wife did not sleep together and did not have a sexual relationship.\nAsked by Mr Sandhu if her son-in-law had ever commented on how he was feeling about their relationship, Mrs Vale said he had told her was lonely, adding: \"He was depressed, he was unhappy, they didn't sleep together.\"\nWhen asked if her daughter had ever said she was lonely, Mrs Vale said: \"She didn't ever admit it, no. She just said it is what it is.\n\"They didn't see much of each other and she accepted it.\"\nMrs Vale said she believed her daughter wanted more support at home and financially from her husband, but despite those issues, was happy and \"absolutely\" looking forward to the future.\nShe also said her daughter would drink wine socially and she had no concerns about the amount she was drinking, but that Mr Samak did not like that she consumed alcohol.\nHe had also allegedly told Mrs Vale he \"couldn't understand\" why his wife still wanted to see her friends after they were married.\nIn a statement, Joanne's best friend and colleague Caroline Edwards said she was not aware of any marital issues, or problems with her mental health or alcohol.\nShe said: \"I know Jo would have told me if there were marital or mental health issues. We often had little moans about our other halves, but it was normal stuff, nothing that gave me concern.\n\"There were no financial issues that I was aware of, but I do know it all fell on Jo's shoulders. It did worry and annoy her from time to time, but she took it all in her stride.\"\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council has included a 3% rise in council tax in its proposed budget for the forthcoming financial year.\nThe rise would comprise a 1% increase in the basic rate of council tax, and an additional 2% increase for the adult social care precept.\nThe increase is expected to generate approximately £4m, over half of which would be used to support adult social care services.\nCouncil leader Chris Read said the budget would \"reflect our commitment to meeting the priorities that Rotherham residents have set out for us\".\nUnder the new rates, the council tax for a Band D property would increase from £1,816.15 to £1,870.63, while Band A properties will see an increase from £1,210.76 to £1,247.09, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.\nThe proposed rise is intended to help fund the increased demand on adult social care services, with £2.7 million allocated specifically for this area.\nProposed investments by the council also include £17 million to support adult social care, £4.3 million to meet the demands of home-to-school transport costs, and £1.5 million towards waste management.\nAdditionally, £2.6 million in savings have been identified across the authority, which would be achieved by improving service delivery efficiency, such as optimising waste collection routes and maximising grant funding in children's services.\nThe council also stated it would use its budget to improve public spaces and enhance safety in town and village centres, creating a new \"Street Safe Team\" with a   particular focus on high-footfall areas.\nOther proposed initiatives include increased investment in road maintenance - with £100,000 allocated to improve road markings across the borough, and additional resources to improve verge maintenance in rural areas.\nA significant investment of £6 million will go toward the Catcliffe Village Flood Alleviation Scheme, aimed at improving flood protection in the area by enhancing the flow path of the River Rother. The scheme is expected to be completed within three to five years.\nA £50,000 allocation will fund a new scheme offering free parking for the first hour in council-operated car parks in the town centre, designed to support local businesses, increase footfall, and encourage residents to shop locally.\nThe proposals will be presented to the cabinet on 10 February, with final approval to be decided by the full council on 5 March.\nRead said: \"This year's funding settlement is one of the largest increases for councils in over a decade, placing Rotherham among the top 12 nationally for funding growth - it is a very welcome change of direction.\"\n\"However, significant challenges remain, and we remain focused on delivering for our residents.\"\n\"Our budget reflects our commitment to meeting the priorities that Rotherham residents have set out for us in numerous public consultations over the last few years—investing in vital services, supporting communities, increasing the economic opportunities open to local people, and improving the look and feel of our communities.\"\nListen to highlights fromSouth Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with thelatest episode ofLook Northor tell us a story you thinkwe should be covering here.\nA festival of illuminated art and sound projections inspired by children is held in Rotherham.\nDeveloper has applied to fill site with solar panels that will have a lifespan of 40 years.\nSplash play facilities at Clifton Park to be improved but council will not introduce entry fee.\nRotherham councillors agree to recommission a 'vital' domestic abuse refuge service.\nThe money was owed by a developer in relation to a failed regeneration project.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The UK needs to \"up its game\" and get a work ethic in order to compete in the global economic race, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said.\nSpeaking toBBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson,he said there were nine million working age adults not in employment and that the UK \"needs everyone to make a contribution\" to keep up with countries like China and India.\nHe said he had worked hard in his career to set up businesses, adding: \"It's worked for me, it can work for the country as well.\"\nDuring the interview, the MP also recalled his time serving under Liz Truss, saying he had urged restraint but wasn't listened to.\nHis comments were seized upon by opponents, including the Lib Dems who said \"no-one can doubt Chris Philp's work ethic after he crashed the economy in just 39 days as Treasury minister under Liz Truss\".\nThe Lib Dem Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \"The British public will no doubt take his advice with a bucketload of salt.\"\nA Labour spokesperson said the Conservatives had \"real brass neck\" to tell the public the previous government's economic failures were \"really all their fault\", in response to Philp's comments.\n\"It's the same old Tories. They haven't changed and they've learned nothing.\"\nThe trade unions also joined the attack, with TUC general secretary Paul Novak saying the comments were \"patronising\" and \"out of touch\".\nAsked whether she agreed with Philp, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"I think everybody should be working hard, including myself.\"\nPhilp was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015, and worked in several ministerial departments in the Conservative government including the Home Office and Ministry of Justice.\nBefore entering politics he set up businesses in finance and travel.\nHe said he developed a strong work ethic in his early teens, delivering newspapers, washing people's cars and working in Sainsburys.\n\"I found that working hard brought its own reward and I've kept doing that ever since.\n\"It is something I would like to infuse more into our national culture as well.\"\nAsked if he thought a belief in hard work was something that was missing in Britain, he replied \"I do a bit.\"\n\"There are nine million working age adults who are not working.\n\"As we compete globally with countries like South Korea, China, India, we need a work ethic, we need everybody to be making a contribution.\n\"We are in a global race that means we have got be competitive and it means we have got to work hard.\n\"As a country we need to up our game.\"\nAlthough Labour has denounced Chris Philp's language, there is perhaps more of a consensus between the two main parties in substance if not style.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has said \"those who can work will work\" and \"as a country we cannot keep footing the bill for the spiralling numbers of people out of work\".\nShe has accepted £3bn cuts in the welfare budget that were pencilled in by the previous Conservative government - though how this is to be achieved will not be clear until details are published in the spring.\nAt leastthree million of the nine million economically inactivepeople are not in work because of health issues - and, without action, this is projected to increase significantly.\nWhen Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced plans to help young people \"earn and learn\" last November she also confirmed that those who chose not to embrace new opportunitiescould lose benefits.\nChris Philp was chief secretary to the Treasury in autumn 2022 when Truss's tax-cutting mini-Budget triggered market turmoil, leading to her resignation as prime minister.\nFollowing the announcement of the measures, Philp had posted a message on social media reading: \"Great to see Sterling strengthening on the back of the new UK growth plan.\"\nHowever, this was shortly followed by a dramatic tumble in the value of the pound as the market reacted badly to the mini-Budget.\nAsked about the post, Philp told Nick Robinson: \"Clearly commenting on currency movement was a dumb idea and I shouldn't have done that - I learnt a lesson.\"\nHe said that Truss's tax reductions should have been accompanied by \"some spending restraint in order to help balance the books and to maintain market confidence\".\n\"I made that case internally... but it wasn't listened to.\"\n\"I was hoping, despite all the difficulties and the very bad market reaction, there was a way to get through it to implement a growth plan... ultimately there wasn't a way of doing that.\n\"Had my suggestions been listened to a bit earlier, there was much higher chance it would have worked.\n\"It will always be a matter of regret that those points weren't taken on board and listened to.\"\nIn a wide ranging interview with Nick Robinson, Philp said that having always worked hard and taken responsibility for his own life, it was difficult when, in 2013, his twins were born prematurely and he was \"not in control\" and had to be reliant on others for help.\nHis son and daughter were born at 25 weeks and one day, only just past the legal limit for abortion.\n\"The doctor was completely honest, he said at this level there is only a 50/50 chance of survival, and even if they survive there's a very significant chance of disability.\n\"That was a moment of shock.\nHe said that there was a \"happy ending\" and that despite a difficult first few years they are \"absolutely fine\".\nYou can listen to the Political Thinking with Nick Robinson interview with Chris Philp on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday at 17:30 GMT or on BBC Sounds.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

The guy who pushed him didn't stop to hang around.\"\nMr Webster recalled blood had pooled around Mr Ward's neck and one of his legs began to shake.\nGreig, from Dundee, denied struggling with the taxi driver, pushing him and repeatedly kicking or stamping on Mr Ward's head.\nHe denied murdering Mr Ward and causing him to die from his injuries.\nPreviously, in January 2023, Greig had been jailed for five years and four months for the attack.\nThen he admitted assaulting Mr Ward to his severe injury, permanent disfigurement, permanent impairment and danger of his life.\nBut following his death three months later the Crown raised the murder charge.\nLady Drummond deferred sentence until March.\nGreig's multiple previous convictions included dishonesty, knife possession, drugs and road traffic offences.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "Five years on since the UK officially left the EU and, so far, Brexit has not been as bad as oysterman Tom Haward thought.\nA year before January 31 2020, his business - Richard Haward's Oysters - decided to stop sending 200,000 oysters a year to the likes of Belgium and France.\nInstead, they have been served-up at more restaurants, fishmongers and markets across Britain.\n\"Brexit didn't really impact us at all in the short term.\n\"We anticipated it would cause a lot of problems with exporting, so we stopped before Brexit happened and then filled that gap with domestic clients.\"\nTom Haward's family have grown and caught oysters around Mersea Island in Essex for nearly three hundred years.  He hopes his daughter will one day become the ninth generation to make her living from the shellfish.\nAt the beginning of this decade, increased demand in the UK ate up the 10% of his oysters that were being exported to continental Europe.\n\"We were seeing a renaissance of love of oysters in the UK.\n\"We were seeing an increase in sales to restaurants, so we were like 'Oh, Brexit hasn't been as bad as we thought it was going to be'.\n\"But that was the beginning. Now we are starting to see, five years on, the implications of Brexit,\" Mr Haward told the BBC.\nThe hospitality sector was \"struggling\" and the oysterman said his customers were not selling the same volumes of oysters in the past year.\n\"We've got a very small market that we are trying to keep hold of and there's not really much growth in the UK.\n\"There are so many other oyster producers fighting for the same customers. I can already see a downward for sales in oysters.\"\nThere were now \"too many barriers, too many complications\" to selling British oysters in mainland Europe, Mr Haward said.\nTo export live shellfish into the EU, export health certificates, origin of product paperwork and veterinary health checks needed to be completed.\nMr Haward said the paperwork and planning would take a week, whereas before Brexit an order from the EU could be made and the oysters would arrive the following day.\nThe bureaucracy, he said, had \"pushed the price up by at least 20%\" and he would \"have to charge a lot more than our European competitors\".\nThere was also a risk live oysters would be delayed in transit and would \"die at the border\".\nTom Haward said he had found a new client in Dubai, which was easier to export to than Dublin.\n\"It's really easy: I write out an invoice, box the oysters up, send them to Heathrow and it's job done.\n\"It's all done the way we used to do it with Europe.\n\"It's easier to get them into the Middle East than across the English Channel, that's the madness of it. It makes me sad.\"\nBefore the Brexit vote, Richard Haward's Oysters was looking to double its EU exports to 20% of sales. Now exports abroad make-up 0.5%.\nThe UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has talked of a reset of relations with the EU and improving market access for food and farm goods.\nBut Tom Haward was pessimistic.\n\"There's a lot of talk and little action regardless of which government is in place,\" he said.\nHe was considering sending oysters to the Far East - demand is high in China.\nBut he was torn over whether it was sustainable to fly oysters \"half-way around the world\" and keep his family harvesting oysters.\nFollow Essex news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.\nBut the PM wants to \"make Brexit work better for the British people\", Downing Street says.\nAn inquest hears how Thomas Collier, 79, was admitted to hospital with drowsiness and facial injuries.\nThe force has been facing backlash over a decision to axe 99 community policing roles.\nFive years on from the deal to leave the EU, Suffolk residents express their views on the change.\nBusiness owners talk about the impact of Brexit five years after leaving the EU.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Residents living near Heathrow Airport have pleaded against plans for a third runway to be built at the UK's biggest airport.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed on Wednesday that the government backed the plans, claiming a third runway could create 100,000 jobs.\nJoanna Wattis, a resident of Datchet, Berkshire, said the community was \"very much against it\" and pleaded for the plans to be dropped.\nBut another resident, Bob Beresford, said he thought Heathrow needed to expand to avoid losing traffic to other European airports.\nThe plans for a third runway received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but have been stuck in limbo after legal challenges ever since.\nOn Wednesday, Reeves invited Heathrow to submit plans to expand the airport, but promised the government would only sign them off if \"in line with legal environmental and climate objectives\".\nMs Wattis said she was \"very much against\" the plans\".\n\"I think it would be a very bad idea for the local community,\" she said.\n\"We're all very much against it and we have enough flights [overhead]. If you think of all the fumes that go into the atmosphere... no. Please, no.\"\nAnother resident, Pauline Herbommez, said she thought it was the wrong move for environmental reasons.\n\"I'm actually trying to reduce my own flying time for carbon emissions so I think it's really truly the wrong way to go about it,\" she said.\n\"Instead of encouraging flying more we should be looking at railways and developing public transport.\"\nShe said she thought the current runways were \"enough\".\n\"For the future of our children, for our actual present, we really need to start thinking about it,\" she said.\n\"[Expanding the airport] is completely against looking after our future. I think it's silly.\"\nTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the government would invest £63m over the next year to support the production of sustainable aviation fuel.\nShe said that would help \"support thousands of jobs, bring down our transport emissions, support our energy security and make the UK a clean energy superpower\".\nMs Beresford said he understood the reasoning behind it, although he conceded it was \"a mixed blessing\".\n\"We do need to expand Heathrow - we're losing traffic,\" he said.\n\"We've got a lot of people who want to come here... but the expansion of Gatwick and places like that  are too far away from central London.\n\"Heathrow is in a good position.\"\nMark Billany, manager of Hemisphere Freight Service Ltd in Slough, said the extra runway would have financial benefits because it could bring down costs for air freight cargo, which he said had risen since Brexit.\nBut he was sceptical of whether the runway would actually be built, saying the promise of a third runway had been \"made many times before and broken\".\n\"We've been here before\", he said.\nSlough's Labour MP, Tan Dhesi, also said Heathrow needed to follow in the steps of other European airports.\n\"Several runways have appeared at Schiphol in Amsterdam,\" he said.\n\"Whether it's in Paris or Frankfurt, those airports all recognise that planes will be taking off... air travel is here to stay. We just need to make it better, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly.\"\nMaidenhead's Liberal Democrat MP Joshua Reynolds is one of several MPs who said he would be opposing the plans.\n\"The environmental costs of a third runway at Heathrow put both our planet and our community at risk,\" he said.\n\"My constituents in Maidenhead deserve growth that improves their lives and local area, not growth that will take years to deliver and lead to big increases in pollution and health risks.\"\nYou can followBBC BerkshireonFacebook,X (Twitter), orInstagram.\nThe airline says it follows feedback about which European destinations islanders wanted.\nThe chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.\nData also shows a 225% increase in the number of residents who received bailiffs visits.\nHow much of Harmondsworth will survive a third runway being built at Heathrow Airport is unknown.\nThe chancellor announced a range of reforms on Wednesday - including a new runway for Heathrow airport.",

    "title": "Holiday fines at record high in England",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "A record 443,322 school holiday fines were issued in England last year, according to new figures from the Department for Education (DfE).\nThe figures from the 2023-24 school year show a 24% rise on the year before, and are three times higher than in 2016-17, when government records began.\nYorkshire and the Humber issued the highest rate of fines for any region.\nThe government says fines have a \"vital place in our system, so everyone is held accountable\" for ensuring children are in school.\n\"My son doesn't do well in large crowds,\" says Sarah, who paid a £320 fine for taking her two children on holiday with her partner during school term time.\nSarah's 10-year-old son, Tyler, is autistic and has ADHD, and struggles to cope with large groups of tourists during the school holidays.\nIt means Sarah has to choose between avoiding popular destinations, or visiting them in the quieter periods during the school term.\nSchools and councils say children should not be out of class during term time, but Sarah says the holiday crowds \"would be too much\" for Tyler.\nIn July 2024 the family from Leicestershire went on holiday to Turkey during the summer term, which meant the children missed six days of school.\nSarah says she has even considered home-educating her children, adding: \"I feel like I don't have full responsibility for them, the fact I can't pull them out of school for a holiday.\"\nMost local authorities saw a rise in the number of holiday fines issued, but there was wide variation across England.\nBarnsley in Yorkshire and the Humber has the highest rate, at 183 per 1,000 pupil enrolments.\nNewcastle upon Tyne saw the largest relative rise - from 161 fines issued in 2022-23 to 1,971 last year.\nAt 14,632 Birmingham, the largest local authority in the country, issued the most last year, up 33% from 2022-23.\nThe DfE says it is aware of discrepancies between local authorities issuing fines, which is why from August 2024 new statutory guidance set national requirements for issuing school fines.\nIn August 2024, the DfE introduced a new national framework to bring councils more in line with each other. However, it says it is the local authority's responsibility to decide when to issue fines to parents.\nThe government says, in most cases, schools and local authorities will try to provide support to help improve a child's attendance – but if this is ineffective or the absence is for an unauthorised term-time holiday, parents may face a fine.\nAccording to DfE guidelines issued in August 2024:\nThe DfE says money from fines goes to the local authority.\nLeicestershire County Council says it offers advice to parents to \"minimise the impact that missed school days can have on a child's education\".\nHowever, Sarah says her family's trip to Turkey was educational.\n\"The kids got to learn about all sorts of Turkish culture, Turkish food, Turkish currency,\" she says. \"But that doesn't mean anything, because I'm neglecting my children because I took them out of school.\"\nFor many families, cost benefits also play a huge part in the decision to take holidays during term time, with tripsoften costing thousands more during the school holidays.\nDoncaster Council issued the fourth highest rate of fines of any local authority in England in 2023-2024, with 160 per 1,000 pupil enrolments.\nKaty Taylor-Clarke, principal at The Laurel Academy in Mexborough, near Doncaster, says \"it's a big issue\".\nThe school employs two attendance officers who spend all day phoning and visiting the parents of children who do not show up in the morning.\nIn a bid to help parents try to find cheaper holidays, schools across Doncaster have moved their Easter holidays a week earlier this year.\n\"Some of the frustration lies with the travel companies who inflate the prices,\" says Miss Taylor-Clarke.\n\"But ultimately, children need to be in school.\n\"As a general rule of thumb, we won't authorise a term-time holiday. We have to be consistent, because it's not fair if we fine some parents and not others.\"\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary at the National Association of Head Teachers, says fines are a \"crude tool, and do not address more complex underlying causes of absence\".\nTo improve attendance, he says there needs to be more support for children with special educational needs, as well as more investment in community services, mental health support and social care.\nSchool leaders are also in a difficult position, he says, because there are no national guidelines on what the \"exceptional circumstances\" are in which schools can give pupils time off.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"we need a national effort to tackle the epidemic of school absence\", adding fines have a \"vital place in our system, so everyone is held accountable\" for ensuring children are in school.\n\"When children miss school unnecessarily, all children suffer, as teachers' attention is diverted to helping them catch back up, and we will not apologise for ensuring every child is in school accessing high and rising standards so they can achieve and thrive,\" she said.\nAdditional reporting by Miguel Roca-Terry and Jonathan Fagg\nThe National Lottery operator says it is \"very unusual\" for such a large prize to go unclaimed this long.\nPeople risk a penalty, the HMRC has warned, without a reasonable excuse for delays.\nDoncaster Royal Infirmary is in a state of disrepair and no longer fit for purpose, officials say.\nAverage annual water bills in England and Wales will rise by £123 in April but some will pay more.\nFigures reveal a jump for billpayers in England and Wales despite questions over firms' performance.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "A man accused of the \"callous and cowardly\" murder of three police officers in 1982 could be linked to the case by DNA evidence, a court has heard.\nMartin McCauley, with an address in Naas in County Kildare, appeared before Craigavon Magistrates' Court on Thursday after being extradited from the Republic of Ireland.\nThe court heard \"modern era\" forensics could match the 62-year-old's DNA to that identified on cigarette butts found at the scene at the time of the killings.\nMr McCauley is to stand trial for the murder of the three Royal Ulster Constabulary  officers in an explosion at Kinnego Embankment near Lurgan in County Armagh in October 1982.\nThe officers were Sgt Sean Quinn, and constables Allan McCloy and Paul Hamilton.\nThey were on duty when the car they were travelling in drove over a bomb that had been hidden in the road and was detonated by remote control.\nThe IRA claimed responsibility for the attack.\nAll three officers were in an unmarked police car and the bomb was detonated remotely by a command wire.\nTwo people suspected of involvement at the time were shot dead two weeks later by the RUC.\nMr McCauley, who is originally from County Armagh, has lived south of the border since the late 1990s.\nHe was returned on Thursday morning to Northern Ireland, where he appeared before court and was subsequently granted bail.\nMr McCauley is one of the so-called Colombia Three.\nHe was arrested alongside two others in Colombia in 2001 and was accused of the IRA training of rebel FARC guerrilla forces.\nThey were initially cleared of the charge, only to be convicted on appeal and sentenced to 17 years in jail.\nBut the three men avoided imprisonment by fleeing Colombia in 2004. They turned up in the Republic of Ireland a year later.\nA PSNI detective inspector told the court that Mr McCauley's case in Colombia and the fact he fled that country were grounds to suggest he could travel the world without a passport.\nThey told the court that they objected to granting bail because there was a risk of flight, a risk of further offences and a risk of interfering with witnesses.\nThey said the 1982 murder of three RUC officers while on duty had been \"callous and cowardly\", and that they were satisfied they could connect the accused to the case because \"a modern era forensic examination of DNA matching the defendant's had been detected on cigarette butts smoked and deposited at the scene\".\nGranting bail, the judge said he did not believe the risks set out by the PSNI and prosecution had been met.\nMr McCauley's lawyer told the court that his client had strong family ties to his home in County Kildare, including three vulnerable grandchildren to whom he was \"pivotal\" in providing care.\nThe lawyer said Mr McCauley was also prepared to sign in with his local gardai every day, and that he was also prepared to offer a cash surety to abide by the terms of his bail.\nLawyers for Mr McCauley have previously said he denies the charges against him.\nThe case was adjourned until 26 February.\nPolice say the man was shot at his home in the Ballygallin Park area of Coleraine on Thursday evening.\nAt its peak 30% of all premises in Northern Ireland had their power disconnected.\nThe education minister says a resolution is \"close\" but a union says negotiations are continuing.\nThe 50-year-old was remanded into custody charged with possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances.\nPolice believe that road closure signage had been removed prior to the crash.",

    "title": "'We were blindsided': Federal workers react to buy-out offer",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "The late-night announcement was an email, sent to some two million federal workers. Subject line: Fork in the Road.\nIn it, federal employees were advised they could take part in a \"deferred resignation program\", an offer akin to gradual buy-out. Anyone who opted in could stop work immediately but be paid as normal for eight months, before formally leaving their role in government at the end of September.\n\"My email came through at 10:51 last night,\" said Monet Hepp, a medical support specialist at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), one of the country's largest federal agencies with more than 300,000 people on staff. \"So people came into the office and were greeted by this. It was the first thing everyone was talking about.\"\nThe directiveis part of an ongoing effort by the White House to slash the size of the federal government and weed out employees who do not support Donald Trump's second term agenda. The administration said it expects as many as 200,000 - roughly 10% of the federal workforce - to accept the offer, which expires on 6 February.\nBut many federal employees say the proposal has come as a shock, with still unanswered questions about the process piling on uncertainty to an already hectic start to Trump's second term. And several workers who spoke to the BBC referred to what they called a \"threatening\" undertone to the offer, the suggestion that even for those who stay, their once-secure government roles are now up in the air.\n\"At this time, we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency,\" the OPM statement read.\n\"The tone of the initial email was like 'you may be cut anyway,'\" Hepp said. \"People were blindsided by it.\"\nAs Wednesday morning unfolded, federal employees scrambled to find more information, slowly filling in the gaps left by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government's human resources agency and the body that sent the Tuesday evening missive.\nThe message had been so unexpected, so tonally distinct from typical government communication, that some thought it was spam, and promptly deleted it.\n\"I want to confirm that this is a legitimate communication from OPM,\" a public affairs officer with the VA wrote in an email that was sent to employees and shared with the BBC.\nEmployees said they volleyed questions back and forth to each other, realising their managers knew no more than they did. How would this affect retirement benefits? What about those who quit in the past several days, before the buyout offer?\n\"Leadership absolutely has no idea what is happening,\" said an employee at the Department of Labour, a young mother of a baby daughter who spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive matters.\n\"So when you ask your boss like, 'hey, what does this mean?' they're like 'I don't know. I got the same email, at the same time,'\" she said. \"Everybody is a little panicked, a little confused.\"\nAnd many wondered specifically what guarantees departing employees would have to actually be paid through September, especially beyond March when the budget currently funding the federal government will expire.\n\"People are concerned about, what if I take it and I don't get paychecks? Because we haven't actually seen a contract,\" said a counsellor with the VA Pacific District office, who spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive matters. \"The language in there [the email] is clear as mud.\"\nThe OPM itself issued follow-up guidance. No, employees who took the offer would not have to continue working through September. Yes, you can seek other employment during the resignation period. No, you are under no obligation to resign.\n\"The federal workforce is expected to undergo significant near-term changes. As a result of these changes (and for other reasons), you may wish to depart the federal government on terms that provide you with sufficient time and economic security to plan for your future - and have a nice vacation,\" the OPM wroteon its new FAQ page.\nAnd for at least a couple of the federal employees who spoke to the BBC, this explanation was enough. The VA counsellor said she would likely take the offer, saying she could make more money returning to her private counselling practice.\nHepp, too, said she was strongly considering it because she and her husband, a US marine, may soon be moving overseas. \"This may almost be like a bailout for me,\" she said.\nBut others said they found the offer insulting, like an underhanded way of forcing federal employees out.\nIn a statement, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest federal employee union, said the offer \"should not be viewed as voluntary\".\n\"It is clear that the Trump administration's goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.\"\n\"It's just unsettling to see such a blatant attack on federal employees,\" said the young VA employee. \"It's kind of like a slap in the face.\"\nThese same employees told the BBC they understood that turning down the deferred resignation would offer no guarantee of job security, citing the OPM.\n\"I thought this was a stable job, that I would have a stable income, and now that's all up in the air,\" said another employee at Veterans Affairs who previously served in the US Army and spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive matters.\nThis employee said he plans to \"ride it out\", saying he wanted to continue to give veterans their care, despite being \"hamstrung\" by leadership.\n\"In my nearly 15 years of federal service, I've never seen this,\" he said. \"The morale has just completely crashed,\" he said.",

    "text": "Although Preston North End's season looked to be over before it started as their early campaign descended into turmoil after just one game, they curiously seem to be able to reset their campaign completely and light a fire of optimism with their upcoming game on Friday night.\nThey travel to Ewood Park to play Blackburn Rovers and the start to the season for the Lancashire rivals could not have been more different.\nNorth End's manager ended last season \"unacceptably\" according to chairman Craig Hemmings and so Ryan Lowe walked out one game and one defeat into the 2024-25 season.\nRovers had their boss in place last season and while they did not set the world alight, they were steady and reaped the rewards of their stability as they made a fast start to the campaign.\nBlackburn started the Championship eight unbeaten while Preston won only two of their opening eight matches.\nAnd while North End were going nine games without a win from October, Blackburn during that same time period won six in a row.\nHowever, a win for the Lilywhites on Friday would put them just two points behind Rovers and they will head to East Lancashire backed by more than 5,000 supporters.\nThey also go there off the back of two fine wins against play-off chasers Watford and Middlesbrough and looked good value for the points in both contests.\nSince Boxing Day, only two teams in the division have taken more points than Preston and one of them tops the table.\nOn the other hand, only three teams have taken fewer points than Blackburn.\nFriday's Lancashire Derby is set up to be a potential catalyst for Paul Heckingbottom's side, especially if it brings Blackburn into range.\nThe Yorkshireman has now had time to settle into his role at the helm and has shown the attacking intent and positivity in the football he wants from his side.\nA win to start the weekend and it is game on coming into the turn, post January window.\nPNE have made efforts to improve their squad too, with Lewis Gibson and Jayden Meghoma joining on permanent and loan deals respectively.\nBoth have hit the ground running and with captain Ben Whiteman ruled out for around eight weeks with an ankle injury, Heckingbottom has hinted at potentially doing more January business to bolster their options.\nThere are positive signs for the North End faithful and with one defeat in their past eight when travelling to Ewood they have every reason to be confident of securing more bragging rights.",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.\nOn that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.\nNorthern Ireland had aseparate arrangement.\nBrexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.\nFive years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.\nEconomists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.\nThis is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.\nThe negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.\nThere is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.\nSome recent studies suggest thatUK goods exports are 30% lowerthan they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.\nSomesuggest only a 6% reduction.\nWe can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.\nOne thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.\nThey have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported bysurveys of small firms.\nIt's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting -have done unexpectedly well since 2021.\nBut the working assumption of theOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.\nAnd the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly £100bn in today's money.\nThe OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.\nAfter Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.\nThere have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.\nBut their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.\nHowever, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.\nImmigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.\nThere has beena big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration)since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.\nBut there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.\nA post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.\nUnder this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).\nThe two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.\nUK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.\nThe re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.\nSubsequent Conservative governments reduced therights of people on workandstudent visasto bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.\nFreedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.\nBritish passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.\nPeople can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.\nEU citizens can stay in the UK forup to six months without needing a visa.\nHowever, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.\nIn 2025, the EU is planning to introduce anew electronic Entry Exit System (EES)- an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.\nThis will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.\nIt will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressedfears it could potentially add to border queuesas people leave the UK.\nThe EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.\nAnd six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a newEuropean Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.\nETIAS clearance will cost €7 (£5.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.\nMeanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit -to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)- will cost £16.\nLegal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.\nTo minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".\nAccording to thelatest government countthere were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.\nThe previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.\nBut with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.\nIn May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another500 financial services lawsset to disappear later.\nMost were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.\nAll other EU legislation was kept, though ministersreserved powers to change them in future.\nAnd the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, itbanned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fatteningandchanged EU laws on gene editing crops.\nBrexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.\nEU member states areprohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.\nA zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products wasintroduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 theEU's rules changedso the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.\nThe money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly theLeave campaign's claim the UK sent £350m every week to Brussels.\nThe UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was £18.3bn, equivalent to around £352m per week,according to the Treasury.\nThe UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.\nHowever, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to £5bn in 2019-20.\nSince the end of the transition periodUK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.\nMinisters have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.\nThe UK was also receiving a negotiated\"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around £4bn a year- money which never actually left the country,\nSo the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to £9bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.\nThe UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement.The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of £14.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another £6.4bn, although spread over many years.\nFuture payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.\nHowever, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.\nAfter Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.\nHowever,Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023and is projected by the EU to pay in around €2.4bn (£2bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.\nThere are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.\nClarification: This article has been updated to clarify the amount of time EU citizens can spend in the UK, visa free.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Eight more hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have been released amid chaotic scenes as part of the ceasefire deal with Israel.\nThree Israelis and five Thai nationals were handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas before being transferred to Israeli forces and taken to Israel.\nA total of 110 Palestinians were later released from Israeli prisons, including 32 with life sentences and 30 minors.\nIsrael delayed their release in response to the way the hostages were treated as they were handed over.\nThursday's releases mean 15 hostages have been freed since the ceasefire came into effect on 19 January. Eighty-two are still being held.\nIsraeli soldier Agam Berger, 20, was the first to be released on Thursday - led by masked gunmen through a scene of rubble in a stage-managed event in Jabalia, in the north of Gaza.\nCrowds of civilians were kept back by armed Hamas fighters as she appeared on a platform and was given a certificate, before being passed to the Red Cross.\nShe was one of seven women from an unarmed unit of observers who were kidnapped on 7 October 2023, and the last remaining in Gaza.\nIn Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, crowds watching on a big screen cheered.\n\"I'm thrilled... to see her face, to see her going back to her family. It's exciting,\" Yahel Oren, who served in the same unit as Ms Berger a decade ago, told the BBC.\nPhotos released by the Israeli military showed her hugging four other young women from the unit who were released in the previous exchange on Saturday.\nIn a statement, her family said they could now \"begin the healing process\" but that \"the recovery will not be complete until all the hostages return home\".\nAbout two hours later, in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, the seven other hostages were brought out amid chaotic scenes.\nThey were led by armed fighters through crowds of cheering spectators, many filming with mobile phones, before being handed over to the Red Cross in waiting vehicles.\nIt took place symbolically in front of the remains of the home - bombed by Israel - of late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the 7 October attacks. Sinwar was killed by Israeli troops in Rafah in October 2024.\n\"There was a lot of chaos, there was a lot of pushing,\" a journalist who covered the handover told the BBC. There were chants of Sinwar's name and for Hamas, he said.\nA woman in the crowd said she was \"proud of Gaza's men and Gaza's resistance\".\nIn Tel Aviv, people watched anxiously, as they held Israeli flags and photos of the hostages.\nIn addition to Ms Berger, Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, and Thai agricultural workers Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Seathao and Surasak Lamnao were freed.\nIn a sign of the precariousness of the ceasefire, the release of the prisoners was paused by Israel until it received assurances that the scenes which accompanied the release of the hostages in Khan Younis would not be repeated.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the \"shocking scenes\" were \"additional proof of the inconceivable brutality of the Hamas terrorist organisation\".\nThe prime minster's office later said it had since received from mediators \"a commitment that a safe exit will be guaranteed for our hostages\" yet to be released.\nThe postponement was the latest hitch to hit the delicate and complex reciprocal steps which Israel and Hamas have committed to under the terms of the ceasefire.\nIsrael delayed by two days allowing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza after Hamas failed to include Arbel Yehud in the previous round of hostage releases on 25 January.\nTwo hundred and fifty-one people were taken captive when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. The attack triggered a war which has devastated Gaza.\nIsrael's 15-month military offensive killed 47,460 Palestinians in the territory, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nBefore Thursday, 290 Palestinian prisoners - ranging from those serving long sentences for bombings and other attacks to teenagers held without charge - had been released under the ceasefire.\nMost have returned to the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, while about 70 of the most serious offenders have been deported.\nPalestine Action accuses a Buckinghamshire firm of supplying products to aid Israel's military.\nThe Israeli military says it targeted what it describes as \"armed terrorists\" in the town of Tamoun.\nLebanon and the US said the agreement will remain in place until 18 February.\nIt comes as the deadline passes for Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters to withdraw from southern Lebanon.\nThe missile strike on a Lebanese apartment block targeting Hezbollah left mostly civilians dead, BBC finds.",

    "text": "Sam Prendergast has again been preferred to Jack Crowley\nMen's Six Nations: Ireland v England\nVenue:Aviva StadiumDate:Saturday, 1 FebruaryKick-off:16:45 GMT\nCoverage:Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1.\nSam Prendergast has been retained at fly-half for Ireland's opening Six Nations match against England on Saturday.\nLeinster's Prendergast, 21, started Ireland's last two November Tests and is entrusted to make his Six Nations debut from the start this weekend byinterim head coach Simon Easterby.\nJack Crowley played every minute of Ireland's Six Nations title-winning campaign last year, but despite impressing for Munster in recent weeks, the 25-year-old must settle for a place on the bench.\nEasterby, who has stepped up to replace Andy Farrell while the latter focuses on leading the British and Irish Lions this summer, has also recalled Ryan Baird to the back row.\nBaird's inclusion means Tadhg Beirne switches to the second row with Joe McCarthy - who started every Ireland game in 2024 - ruled out through injury.\nGarry Ringrose is preferred to Leinster team-mate Robbie Henshaw at outside centre, partnering Bundee Aki.\nHaving recently returned from a six-month knee injury layoff, hooker Dan Sheehan starts on the bench with Ronan Kelleher retained.\nKelleher will start alongside Andrew Porter and Finlay Bealham in the front row. Bealham is again required from the start in place of the injured Tadhg Furlong.\nIreland:Keenan; Hansen, Ringrose, Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Porter, Kelleher, Bealham; Ryan, Beirne; Baird, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\nReplacements:Sheehan, Healy, Clarkson, Henderson, Conan, Murray, Crowley, Henshaw.\nCurry twins to start together in England back row\nIreland not focused on hat-trick talk - Gibson-Park\nGoodman praises Sexton role in Ireland's England prep\nMen's Six Nations\nFriday, 31 January - Saturday, 15 March\nPrendergast was seen with a heavily strapped leg in training earlier this week but attack coach Andrew Goodman played down any injury concerns on Tuesday.\nAfter being preferred to Crowley for the win over Australia in November, Prendergast started all four of Leinster's Investec Champions Cup pool games, scoring two tries against Bristol at Ashton Gate.\nHowever, Saturday will be by far the biggest game of the Kildare native's career as he will be expected to orchestrate Ireland's attack against an England side who won last year's encounter at Twickenham.\n\"We've enjoyed some competitive [training] sessions and it wasn't easy selecting a squad for this week's game given the quality of those who haven't made the final 23,\" said Easterby.\n\"Credit to those who missed out on selection for this game, there was obvious disappointment but they all stepped up brilliantly to help prepare the team this week.\n\"England are a talented squad with quality across their panel and we know that we will need to hit the ground running to deliver a winning performance.\"\nEasterby said McCarthy will miss the game in Dublin after a \"nasty blow\" to his head in training on Wednesday.\n\"It's a real disappointment for him and the team but he's good now,\" he added.\n\"It was a rugby collision and innocuous, just a really unfortunate set of circumstances and someone's head landed on his head.\n\"It was a nasty blow but he's come round well.\"\nRingrose's inclusion is the only change to Ireland's backline from the Australia game.\nHugo Keenan remains at full-back while Mack Hansen starts on the right wing after serving his three-game ban for criticising the officials in Connacht's defeat by Leinster in December.\nJames Lowe, who returned from injury in Leinster's win over Stormers last week, starts on the left wing with Jamison Gibson-Park at scrum-half as expected.\nFurlong's ongoing injury troubles mean Bealham extends his run at tight-head prop.\nFurlong missed the November campaign with a hamstring injury, and while he regained fitness in time to be included in Easterby's squad, a calf problem led to him being sent home from Ireland's pre-tournament training camp in Portugal.\nBeirne played three of the November games in the back row, but he moves into the second row to partner James Ryan with Baird given his first start since last year's Six Nations win over Italy alongside Josh van der Flier and captain Caelan Doris.\nEasterby will be able to spring a wealth of experience from the bench in Cian Healy, Conor Murray, Iain Henderson and Henshaw, while Jack Conan returns after missing last summer's Test series in South Africa and the autumn campaign.\nLeinster's Thomas Clarkson, who earned his first two caps in November, is set for his Six Nations debut as a tight-head replacement.\nThis video can not be played\nDrama, despair & smelly socks - pundits relive Six Nations days\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "A woman who suffered a broken jaw and teeth after being assaulted by her ex-boyfriend said she was blamed by him for the attack.\n\"I went to the mirror. My teeth were hanging on by threads from my gums...I could hardly speak; I could only just use my lips. I said to him, 'Do you realise you have ruined my life?' and he said, 'You can thank yourself'.\"\nEva Komuves was speaking at the launch of a new campaign aimed at ending violence against women and girls (VAWG).\nThe Power to Change campaign aims to address the attitudes of men and boys towards women and girls in Northern Ireland.\nThe campaign is being backed by the PSNI, the Department of Justice (DoJ), and the Stormont executive.\nWarning: This content contains images and descriptions that some readers may find upsetting\nMs Komuves is a survivor of physical and psychological violence at the hands of her former partner, who has pleaded guilty to a number of charges and will be sentenced in February.\nShe said her abuse didn't start with violence; it began with words.\n\"He was criticising my work, my hobbies, my daily routine, and my eating habits. He was controlling my circle of friends. He criticised the way I dressed.\"\n\"When I raised it as an issue, he said I was attacking him. He made me feel guilty.\"\nEva said her former partner would \"raise his voice\", and \"when he didn't like what I said he started to punch a chair, a wall\".\nShe said when she confronted her partner about being on dating sites, he punched her for the first time.\n\"He said he would never hit me again,\" she said, but added that he would raise his fist to her face during confrontation.\n\"In a text message he said, 'I would never hit you again, but I enjoy watching you flinch.'\"\nShe recounted another attack when he punched her and she fell.\n\"I had bruises on my legs and hip. I stood up...I felt I was bleeding...I felt that my mouth was full, that I had a hole in my face.\nThe campaign has published a series of films and advertising, urging men and boys to reflect on their actions and language to promote a cultural change.\nOne film shows a man harassing a woman in the gym and being challenged by another man.\nAnother depicts two friends discussing online interactions with a girl and sending her unsolicited sexual images.\nMs Komuves  has had numerous treatments and dental surgeries due to the attack in which her jaw and some of her teeth were broken.\nBut she told the audience at the launch of the campaign that when she looks in the mirror now she sees \"a strong woman who stood up and broke the cycle\".\nSpeaking about the culture of abuse in Northern Ireland, she said \"lad culture\" is accepted and \"it shouldn't be\".\n\"It has gone unchallenged for too long.\n\"We assume that boys are educated on how to speak to women and not treat them as objects, but they are not,\" she added.\nBetween January 2019 and December 2024, 32 women and girls across Northern Ireland were killed by men.\nPSNI chief constable Jon Boutcher said there had been a blind spot in how policing dealt with domestic abuse in the past, but the force is now committed to ending VAWG.\n\"This is about empowering men and boys, not isolating them.\n\"It's time that we men reflected on our own behaviours and attitudes.\"\nBoutcher said: \"Women are not responsible for preventing harassment or misogyny against them...it's not right.\"\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said \"much work has been done\" by the DoJ to \"help make Northern Ireland a safer place for women and girls\".\nShe added that we need to change \"attitudes that permit and enable unacceptable behaviours\".\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill praised Eva for speaking out and said the campaign is \"another important step forward in our collective effort to end violence against women and girls\".\nPolice say the man was shot at his home in the Ballygallin Park area of Coleraine on Thursday evening.\nAt its peak 30% of all premises in Northern Ireland had their power disconnected.\nThe education minister says a resolution is \"close\" but a union says negotiations are continuing.\nThe 50-year-old was remanded into custody charged with possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances.\nPolice believe that road closure signage had been removed prior to the crash.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "More than 40 football clubs in Northern Ireland can now apply for money from a £36.2m fund which was initially announced 14 years ago.\nTheNorthern Ireland Football Funddates back to 2011, when it was called the Sub-Regional Stadia Programme.\nAt the same time, £62.5m was allocated to rebuild Casement Park GAA stadium in west Belfast.\nThe aim of the fund is to improve sporting facilities for players and fans, with clubs like Glentoran, Cliftonville, Larne, Derry City and Coleraine among those expected to apply.\nMaking the announcement, the Communities Minister Gordon Lyons has admitted that much more money will be required but insisted the new fund was \"only a beginning\".\nAn estimated £200m is needed to bring facilities in Northern Ireland up to the required standard.\nLyons was asked by BBC News NI why, in his first year in office, the Casement redevelopment had not yet been delivered.\nHe said: \"There is a significant funding gap between the money that is on the table right now and the plans that are on the table for the redevelopment of Casement Park.\"\nOn football facilities in Northern Ireland, he said he had been shocked at the \"dire\" state of some grounds.\n\"My vision is to improve conditions for players and to provide safe, accessible football grounds for supporters,\" he said.\n\"This will require additional funding in due course, and I will be seeking to sustain the fund with further investment from a range of sources.\"\nIn order to be granted money, clubs must demonstrate that they will contribute at least 5% of the total project costs.\nFor council-owned grounds, this rises to 40%.\nThe fund is open to 41 clubs in total in the men's and women's game.\nThey are all members of the Northern Ireland Football League (NIFL) or League of Ireland who play their home matches at a venue located in Northern Ireland.\nNIFL chief executive Gerard Lawlor welcomed the announcement \"with cautious optimism\".\nHe added: \"This current fund will, unfortunately, have nowhere near the impact as initially intended, and as the minister himself has stated, much more is needed to have the required impact.\"\nIrish FA President, Conrad Kirkwood, called it a \"positive step forward\".\nHe added: \"It is long overdue and falls significantly short of the Department for Communities' own estimated £200 million required to upgrade performance club grounds, grassroots facilities, and establish a National Football Centre for Northern Ireland.\"\nNot all of the £36.2m is available to the 41 clubs mentioned.\nSome of the money is earmarked for grassroots facilities and the planned new National Football Centre.\nThe clubs can apply for one of three categories of grants:\nThe application process is expected to close in mid-March.\nIt is not clear how long it will be before the first money is handed out, and work on new projects can begin.\nMinister Lyons said he wants to see improvements at league grounds begin \"as quickly as possible\".",

The whole group played well but we were going to need some young boys to make an impact and not just the three goalscorers.\n\"We had a couple of 18-year-olds in there as well who continue to drive us on. So it is a great night for the club and something the whole academy should be proud of.\"\nMikey Moore does not turn 18 until August\nScarletthad been on loan in the Championship at Oxford United until recently.\n\"There was a certain number nine, Harry Kane, at this football club that went on loan to Leyton Orient, Millwall, Leicester, and ended up becoming a legend of this club,\" said Crouch.\n\"Of course that is a lot for Dane Scarlett to live up to, that calibre of player. But when he came on I thought his all-round game was brilliant.\"\nForward Scarlett has also had loan spells in the Championship at Ipswich and in League One with Portsmouth.\nLondon-bornAjayiwas at Bromley before joining Tottenham's academy.\nThe forward made two appearances for the under-18s in 2021-22 while still a schoolboy.\nMeanwhile, attacking midfielderMoorejoined Tottenham a decade ago and has progressed through the ranks to play for the first team.\nEarlier this season, Tottenham's England midfielder James Maddison likened Moore to Brazil's Neymar.\n\"From minute 45 to 65 I thought we had Neymar on the left wing,\" said Maddison about Moore after the Europa League win over AZ Alkmaar on 24 October.\n\"He was brilliant. Just demanding the ball and fearless.\"\nTottenham became the first English side to have three scorers under the age of 21 in a major European match since Arsenal in October 2007.\nThe win over Elfsborg meant Spurs avoid an unwanted two-leg play-off in February.\nThey have four Premier League games - as well as an EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool and an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Aston Villa - before they play in Europe again.\n\"The fact the three young lads have come into the team and scored and made the difference, it's just lifted the whole place,\" added Crouch.\n\"The manager has been under so much pressure and under so much stress.\n\"But everyone's coming away pleased tonight because they've seen three young lads start their careers.\"\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "Chloe Kelly began her senior career with Arsenal, making her debut in 2015\nEngland forward Chloe Kelly has joined Arsenal on loan from Manchester City for the remainder of the season after a rollercoaster January transfer window.\nThe 27-year-old was the subject of heavy speculation throughout the month as she sought a move away from City.\nRivals Manchester United had made an offer for the striker on deadline day but it was rejected by City before a loan agreement with Arsenal was struck.\nKelly is ineligible to play on Sunday when City host Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL).\nOn Wednesday, Kelly posted on Instagram that she wanted \"to be happy again\" and did not see her future at City beyond the summer.\nHer contract is due to expire in June but Kelly, who has made just one WSL start this season, was concerned about her place in the England squad with the 2025 European Championship taking place in July.\nShe scored the winning goal against Germany when England created history by winning their first major women's tournament at Euro 2022.\nKelly added on Wednesday: \"With the Euros fast approaching, this summer is a huge one and I want to be in a position to give it my best shot to represent my country.\n\"However, to be dictated whom I can and can't join with only four months left of the football season is having a huge impact on not only my career by my mental wellbeing.\n\"The situation has been dragged on for too long, it's disappointing and not right.\"\nHer only WSL start this season came against West Ham in October but she hopes to secure a place in the England squad with regular minutes at Arsenal.\nKelly's intentions to leave Manchester City were well-known throughout January but it became an increasingly toxic stand-off between the England international and the club.\nIn the hours leading up to Thursday's 23:00 GMT deadline, City received offers from WSL clubs Brighton and Manchester United which were not accepted.\nSources at the club say one of those offers did not include an agreement to pay Kelly's wages until the end of the season.\nUnited's interest was first reported in the build-up to Manchester City's defeat in the derby at Etihad Stadium, with Kelly absent from the squad.\nArsenal's offer came in late on Thursday and was accepted by City, with both parties keen to reach a resolution.\nKelly's departure was not a smooth one after she claimed City were \"dictating\" who she could or could not join in her social media post on Wednesday.\nCity did not comment publicly but will likely be relieved the saga is over, while Kelly's wish to leave in search of regular game time has finally been granted.\nHer place in the England squad remains under huge risk and she will need to compete for a place in Arsenal's squad to gain minutes before July.\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "A man who considered himself fit and healthy has spoken out about the dangers of high blood pressure after suffering a life-changing stroke.\nNeill Howarth, 60, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, lived an active lifestyle and was a keen cyclist until his undiagnosed high blood pressure triggered a stroke.\nFollowing his collapse on 7 October 2024, the former electrical engineer now has limited use of his left arm, fatigue, and mental health challenges.\n\"I never thought I'd fit the bill for someone who could have a stroke. I was told by my doctor that my blood pressure was high a few weeks before, but I had no symptoms,\" Mr Howarth said.\nA stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, killing brain cells.\nThe effects of a stroke depend on where it takes place in the brain, and how big the damaged area is.\nAccording to theStroke Association, the only charity in the UK providing life-long support for all stroke survivors, 1.4 million people in the UK are survivors of stroke.\nSomeone in the UK has a stroke every five minutes, with high blood pressure accounting for around half.\nOn arrival to hospital, Mr Howarth was given thrombolysis, a treatment that dissolves blood clots and restores blood flow to the brain.\nWhile it helped his recovery, he has been left with lasting sign effects.\n\"I have no left arm [function] and I find intricate tasks impossible,\" he said.\n\"I get very frustrated with the tiniest things I used to do but now cannot, like tying my shoe laces.\n\"My independence has completely gone too. I was very independent and now I am totally reliant on others to support me.\"\nMr Howarth now wants others to take high blood pressure seriously.\n\"I wish I'd known more about the importance of knowing my blood pressure,\" he said, adding: \"It took having the stroke for me to realise just how serious high blood pressure is.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.\nStroke survivors are urging people to get potentially \"life saving\" blood pressure checks.\nThe trial is looking at how a specialised device can help strengthen hand and arm function.\nHelen Shelton, from Sheffield, is part of a medical trial it is hoped will help stroke survivors.\nRyan Thomas' wife says he \"survived the un-survivable\" but faces a long road to recovery.\nPatients suffering strokes will instead be treated in Taunton or Dorchester, under new plans.",

The BBC has contacted West Midlands Police for comment.\nThe hospital, run by Cygnet Health Care Limited, has changed its use since the inspection and now only provides services to adult male patients.\nThe report, after a CQC visit to the 43-bed mental health unit in July, said inspectors reviewed CCTV footage for three cases of restraint where children were physically abused by staff.\n\"Staff were observed dragging children and young people during these incidents,\" they said.\n\"For all three incidents reviewed, there was no apparent risk requiring restraint presented by the young person.\"\nThey added there was no evidence of staff trying to de-escalate the situation before restraining the children.\nThe report said footage identified 12 members of staff as \"passive bystanders\" who did not raise concerns.\nFour out of seven children they spoke to said they \"did not feel safe at the service\".\nIn September,Health Secretary Wes Streeting saidthe decision to close the children's service was the \"right one\" and called abuse allegations at the unit \"truly shocking\".\nAt the time, the hospital acknowledged \"inappropriate use of restraint during very difficult circumstances\".\nThe CQC said three warning notices were sent to the hospital for failing to meet regulations relating to abuse during cases of restraint.\nDespite its change of use, the CQC said the hospital was still registered as able to provide mental health services to children and adolescents.\nThe hospital remains rated as \"requires improvement\".\nA statement from the hospital said it continued to \"strongly refute any allegations of abuse\".\n\"We will continue to work transparently to demonstrate our commitment to maintaining high standards of care and look forward to the publication of the most recent CQC inspection, which took place in October 2024,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe hospital said police and local safeguarding authorities closed their investigations into a number of safeguarding incidents and that no further action would be taken by the organisations.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.\nHolly Farmer says heating was one item she could not \"scrape by\" on in her Sandwell home.\nA couple who postponed their wedding during covid are to renew their vows at Coventry Cathedral.\nTwo petitions had demand street lights be restored, gaining 2,000 and nearly 1,500 signatures each.\nMany frequent A&E visitors are lonely or experiencing poor mental health, says a new support service.\nKnife crime in the West Midlands Police area falls by 6% compared to the previous year.",

    "text": "The Bishop of Warrington has identified herself as one of the women who had accused the Bishop of Liverpool of sexual misconduct.\nThe Right Reverend Bev Mason released an open letter accusing the Church of England of \"not properly and satisfactorily\" addressing concerns about the Right Reverend Dr John Perumbalath.\nBishop Perumbalathannounced he was stepping downearlier following allegations outlined in a Channel 4 News programme.\nHe said he \"consistently denied\" any wrongdoing but was resigning to avoid becoming a \"distraction\".\nOne woman had accused the bishop of kissing her without consent and groping her in Chelmsford in Essex, where the clergyman was Bishop of Bradwell. Another woman told Channel 4 News she was sexually harassed by him.\nBishop Mason confirmed she was the second complainant but said she had chosen to \"distance herself\" from the \"media activity\" since the allegations were publicised.\nThe Cheshire bishop said in her letter to the diocese: \"My prayer is that now things have been brought into the light, there will be no more defensiveness but an honest scrutiny of what we are doing, how we are doing it, where the gaps sit and how we address them.\"\nBishop Mason was formerly the acting Bishop of Liverpool before Bishop Perumbalath was enthroned in 2023.\nShe said in March 2023 she was made aware of a complaint against Bishop Perumbalath which involved an investigation by the church's National Safeguarding Team.\nShe said she then raised \"what I believed to be significant concerns\" including her own allegations.\nSince that time, she said she had \"remained consistent\" in her pursuit of \"proper ecclesiastical judicial process\".\n\"The focus of my concerns centred around due process,\" she wrote.\n\"A bishop cannot be above the law.\"\nAddressing the Diocese of Liverpool, she said: \"I am only too mindful of the turmoil, shock and bruising that you will be reeling from as a result of these past days as you have tried to make sense of this and my long and terrible absence.\n\"For my part, I am deeply sorry for my absence and silence. It has been excruciating.\"\nPolice in Essex had concluded no further action was needed over one allegation in the Channel 4 investigation, while the Church of England said its investigation had also found no case to answer.\nHowever, church leaders called for Bishop Perumbalath to step aside, saying his position was \"untenable\".\nJulie Conalty, the Bishop of Birkenhead and deputy lead bishop for safeguarding, agreed that Bishop Perumbalath \"needed to step back\" but said he had not had \"the chance to defend himself\".\nThe bishop told BBC Radio 4: \"It feels to me that it may have been unfair to all parties.\n\"It strikes me that the bishop has not had a chance to defend himself in tribunal and nor have the complainants been able to go to tribunal with the complaint.\"\nShe said there were questions over whether church processes served both victims and those who had been accused.\n\"Our complaint processes are not trauma-informed, they don't serve victims and survivors well,\" she added.\nShe added that the church needed to have a \"more open conversation\" about misogyny faced by female clergy.\nThe Church of England has been contacted for comment.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside onBBC Soundsand follow BBC Merseyside onFacebook,X, andInstagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight onBBC iPlayer.\nThe council says it will ask the county's police and crime commissioner to help fund the service.\nThe denial comes after a Channel 4 report about a meeting to appoint the Bishop of Liverpool.\nCheshire and Warrington is set to be the name of a proposed new combined authority for the area.\nManager Arne Slot says Liverpool want Mohamed Salah, who is out of contract in the summer, to sign a new deal.\nBill Connors, from Solihull, left a man with life-changing injuries after fleeing the scene of a crash.",

    "text": "Royal Mail should only deliver second-class letters every other weekday and not on Saturdays to protect the future of the UK's postal industry, the industry regulator has proposed.\nOfcom said the Universal Service Obligation (USO) must be reformed as people send fewer letters every year but stamp prices keep rising.\nThe one-price-goes-anywhere USO means Royal Mail has to deliver post six days a week, from Monday to Saturday, and parcels on five from Monday to Friday.\nOfcom said Royal Mail should continue to deliver first-class letters six days a week but second class will be limited to alternate weekdays.\nThere would be no changes to parcel deliveries under the new proposals.\n\"The world has changed, we're sending a third of the letters we were 20 years ago,\" said Natalie Black, Ofcom's group director for networks and communications.\n\"We need to reform the postal service to protect its future and ensure it delivers for the whole of the UK.\"\nThe regulator said Royal Mail's delivery performance was \"not good enough\", noting that it has fined the company more than £16m over the past 18 months.\nBut, among the reforms it is proposing, Ofcom has suggested reducing Royal Mail's next-day delivery target for first-class post from 93% to 90%.\nIt has also proposed dropping the target for second-class mail arriving within three days from 98.5% to 95%.\nThe number of letters Royal Mail delivers has fallen from a peak of 20 billion in 2004-05 to 6.6 billion last year.\nHowever, the price of stamps have continued to rise. Since 2022, Royal Mail has hiked the cost of a first class stamp five times from 85p to £1.65.\nIt has also increased the cost of a second class stamp over the same period from 66p to 85p.\nOfcom said making changes to second-class deliveries could save the loss-making Royal Mail between £250m and £425m.\n\"This could enable it to improve reliability and redeploy existing resources to growth areas such as parcels,\" it said.\nEmma Gilthorpe, chief executive of Royal Mail, said the proposals recognise the \"urgent need for change\" to protect the future of the USO.\n\"Our proposal was developed after speaking to thousands of people and is designed to preserve what matters most—maintaining a one-price-goes-anywhere service and first-class deliveries six days a week.\n\"Reform is crucial to support a modern, sustainable, and reliable postal service for our customers, our company, and our people.\"\nBut the Post Office has objected to the changes.\n\"Our postmasters and customers, particularly those who are vulnerable, do not want to see a reduction in the Universal Service Obligation,\" said a spokesperson for the Post Office.\n\"The proposals announced today put more pressure on postmasters who are already facing tough trading conditions.\"\nLynda Parker from Manchester said postal services near her are already \"a bit of a shambles,\" so reducing deliveries \"will only make matters worse\".\nMs Parker said she is supposed to receive letters about her hospital appointments but due to slow delivery times she only finds out about them through text reminders.\n\"When I get to the hospital they ask for a letter but nothing has arrived,\" she said. \"It's happened several times. I've been lucky because I've received the texts but not everyone has that.\n\"It goes down as a missed appointment—for an appointment you don't know you have.\"\nOfcom has launched a consultationon the new proposals online, which is open to the public until 10 April 2025. A decision is expected in the summer.\nRoyal Mail will include 37 of its 1,200 delivery offices in a pilot scheme, which will deliver second-class mail three days a week, starting in February.\nAccording to the Greeting Card Association, over \"a million households and small businesses\" will be impacted by the pilot.\nAffected mail centres include those in Belfast, Glasgow, Newcastle, Sheffield, London, Cardiff, and Southampton.\nRoyal Mail and the Communication Workers Union have published afull list of the local delivery officesthat will be part of the pilot.\nRoyal Mail's parent company is being sold to a business controlled by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky in a deal worth £3.6bn, after the Labour government approved the deal last year.\nThe government will maintain a \"golden share\" which means Mr Kretinsky's business will have to get approval for any changes to Royal Mail's ownership, the location of its headquarters and its tax residency.\nRoyal Mail must also adhere to the USO, which Mr Kretinsky has pledged he will do for \"as long as I am alive\".\nAdditional reporting by Mary Litchfield",

    "text": "Harvey Weinstein has begged a court in New York to bring forward his retrial for sex crimes, citing his deteriorating health and conditions at the Rikers Island prison, which he called a \"hell hole\".\nAt a court hearing at Manhattan's Criminal Court on Wednesday, Judge Curtis Faber scheduled the disgraced Hollywood producer's trial for 15 April.\nWearing a navy blue suit and in a wheelchair, Weinstein told the judge he might not live that long.\n\"I can't hold on anymore. I'm holding on because I want justice for myself and I want this to be over with,\" he said.\nThe 72-year-old has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he wastaken to hospital for heart surgeryand has spent time in a secure hospital unit.\nIn court, he said every day was a struggle because of his health and that he was in \"a serious emergency situation\".\nHis lawyers have previously complained that he is receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous facility, which officials plan to close.\nWeinstein told the judge that the situation at Rikers was \"medieval\" and remained a stain on the city. He said just that morning, a new nurse had given him the wrong pills, which he caught at the last second.\nJudge Faber said he was empathetic but had another murder trial before his.\n\"I'm begging the court to move your date so we can have that date instead and proceed with this trial as quickly as we can and get out of this hell hole,\" Weinstein told him.\nThe judge agreed to consider moving the trial up by a week.\nWeinstein's landmark 2020 rape conviction was overturnedby the New York court of appeals. It found he did not get a fair trial because women who were allegedly abused by Weinstein were allowed to testify against him despite not being a part of the charges.\nIt was a major blow to the MeToo movement, which launched after the bombshell allegations against the Oscar-winning producer in 2017.\nThe once untouchable Hollywood heavyweight is being retried on charges that heraped an aspiring actor Jessica Mann in 2013and forcibly performed oral sex on production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006.\nAt the same time, he also faces a new sexual assault charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. He denies any wrongdoing.\nJudge Faber denied Weinstein's bid to have the new charge dismissed.\nWeinstein remains in custody because of a separate conviction for rape in California for which he was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of targeted responses.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.\nThe president started his White House news conference as \"consoler-in-chief\" but then pivoted into unevidenced political blame, writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.",

And it's painful, it's riveting.\"\nGraham, who also wrote the BBC drama Sherwood, said Thatcher still \"looms large\" in the communities that he grew up in.\nHe added: \"If people watch the drama, I encourage people then to go and watch the actual interview on YouTube, because it is like a piece of theatre to me.\"\nThe show is based on a book by political editor and TV producer Rob Burley.\nThe first episode aired on Wednesday, with the second appearing on screen on Thursday.\nFollow BBC Nottingham onFacebook, onX, or onInstagram.

    "title": "Combative Trump blames DEI policies after air tragedy",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Donald Trump stood before the White House press room cameras on Thursday to perform a traditional presidential duty – consoler-in-chief during a time of tragedy.\nHe said the country was in mourning, shared his condolences during \"an hour of anguish\" and paid tribute to first responders and the victims.\nThen he sharply pivoted - providing yet another reminder of how his new presidency is going to be very different.\nIt will be combative. It will be unscripted. And it will be quick to point the finger of blame.\n\"We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas,\" he said.\nHe then speculated, without giving evidence, that lowered standards of hiring for air traffic controllers in the Federal Aviation Administration during the Joe Biden and Barack Obama presidencies may have been a factor in the disaster.\nTrump and his fellow Republicans have regularly attacked \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" programmes in the federal government.\nHis team has made undoing such programmes a core part of their first days in office, saying they have divided Americans and weakened the country.\nAnd less than 24 hours after the first major US air disaster in more than a decade, Trump – along with his secretaries of transportation and defence, and his vice-president – took turns hammering their point, even as they provided no evidence that federal hiring practices had any connection to this particular crash.\nAsked by a reporter how he could blame diversity programmes for the crash when the investigation had only just begun, the president responded: \"Because I have common sense.\"\nAt other moments, he acknowledged there was no confirmed cause, saying \"it's all under investigation\".\nTrump said the hiring guidance for the FAA's diversity and inclusion programme included preference for those with disabilities involving \"hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism\".\nAn archived version of a website for the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring programme that appears to have been taken down in December included a similar list. The agency was seeking people with \"targeted disabilities\" that the federal government was prioritising for recruitment at the time.\nBut it's unclear how that drive to make recruitment more diverse may have impacted the ranks of air traffic controllers, who President Trump said needed to all be \"naturally talented geniuses\". The FAA has more than 35,000 employees, only a fraction of which perform that role.\nIn response to criticisms over diversity hiring practices last year, the agency released a statement asserting that all new hires must meet \"rigorous qualifications\" that \"vary by position\".\nThe agency has faced criticism over a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic caused massive disruptions in commercial air travel.\nReports suggest that staffing levels at Reagan airport on Wednesday night may have been compromised.\nIn his remarks, Trump specifically blamed Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom he described with an obscenity and said had ran the department \"into the ground\".\nButtigieg defended his record on social media, calling Trump's comments \"despicable\". \"As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying,\" he said.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also criticised Trump's comments.\n\"It's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracies, it's another for the President of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered,\" Schumer said.\nOnce he departed from his prepared remarks, however, speculation was what President Trump seemed most interested in offering.\nAlong with his condemnation of DEI policies, he offered extended discussion of the angles and elevation at which the two aircraft were flying, the weather conditions on Wednesday night, the temperature of the Potomac and the behaviour of the Army helicopter.\n\"We had a situation where we had a helicopter that had an ability to stop,\" he said. \"For some reason, it just kept going.\"\nBut on Thursday evening, the White House doubled down on blaming his predecessor and DEI policies. The president signed a memorandum to end diversity efforts in the aviation sector and to review all hiring decisions and changes to safety protocols made during the Biden administration. He also signed an executive order to appoint a new head of the FAA.\nTwo things were very clear from Trump's remarks on Thursday.\nThe first is that his eagerness to inject himself into a major news story is undiminished in his new term. And the second is that in his view it is never too soon to inject politics into national tragedy – and use it to attack opponents and advance his agenda.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter. Readers in the UK cansign up here. Those outside the UK cansign up here.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of targeted responses.\nThe concert, which also featured Dr Dre and Pink, took place to help raise funds to rebuild the LA area.\nThe collision between a passenger plane and a military helicopter is suspected to have killed all 67 onboard.\nNew drug suzetrigine, known by its brand name Journavx, has been approved to treat moderate to severe pain.\nThe president also suggested he still plans to impose new tariffs on China but did not give any details.",

    "text": "This video can not be played\nMan City survive Brugge scare to qualify from group phase\nManchester City's Champions League campaign could have gone the same way as the merchandise stand outside Etihad Stadium that went up in flames before kick-off - but a fightback on the pitch meant they scraped into the play-offs.\nEven City manager Pep Guardiola sensed the bad omens, saying: \"When I saw the fire before the game I thought 'the journalists have their headlines already'.\"\nThankfully, no-one was hurt in that pre-match drama, while City were also able to finally emerge unscathed from a night of tension and nerves, displaying more of the fragility that has characterised their season.\nIt's Real Madrid or Bayern Munich next - a scenario that might send shudders down the spine of the most ardent City follower.\nCity's final placing of 22nd in the new Champions League opening phase afterWednesday's 3-1 win against Club Bruggeshould be a source of embarrassment to a club of such high ambition, winners of this tournament in 2023.\nAnd yet, for a short while, it look like it was going to be a lot worse as Guardiola's side faced the humiliation of not even making the play-offs.\nApart from one noisy corner occupied by Brugge fans, you could have heard a pin drop when Raphael Onyedika's low drive right on half-time left City needing two goals to score the win they required.\nA play-off spot would have been viewed as an unlikely consolation prize at the start of the campaign. When even that began to fade from view, this season's sense of crisis was heightening.\nCity were vulnerable at the back, with weakness out wide once more, and blunt in attack. This was only the second time a team managed by Guardiola failed to have a first-half shot on target, following on from a game against Borussia Dortmund in September 2022.\nThose home fans inside the stadium were subdued. City had given their supporters nothing to ease their growing concerns.\nGuardiola had gone through agonies in his technical area, clutching his head in anguish on several occasions as City were hit on the break, also aiming a wild kick at a drinks box, although he laughed this off afterwards with a reminder about his stellar playing career at Barcelona.\nThis video can not be played\nWe deserve to meet Munich or Madrid next - Guardiola\nFire at Etihad Stadium before Champions League game\nWho is through in Champions League and what's next?\nLiverpool close to perfection - who else shone in Champions League?\nThis video can not be played\n'Oh my word!' - Onyedika shocks Man City to give Brugge lead\nIn the wider context, this was City's season on the line - European ambitions threatened while languishing 12 points adrift of Premier League leaders Liverpool, their hold on that crown loosened.\nIt is to City's credit that they responded, helped by Guardiola's effective change of Savinho for Ilkay Gundogan at half-time, meaning the manager avoided the fate of failing to reach the knockout stage for the first time in his silver-lined career.\nIf City had gone out, it would have ended a run of 11 successive seasons in which they have reached the knockout stage - anything else would have been a severe body blow to the pride and status of a club who cherish their place at Europe's top table.\nCity survived what would have been their biggest embarrassment under Guardiola, but on current form a play-off against either Real or Bayern to reach the last 16 cannot be approached with confidence.\nIt was only when the unfortunate Joel Ordonez turned Josko Gvardiol's cross into his own net to give City the lead that Brugge's threat was finally extinguished, their supporters also celebrating at the final whistle as they sneaked into the play-offs in 24th place.\nThe home side got there in the end, but this campaign has so far offered nothing to suggest there should be any fears for either Madrid's elder statesman boss Carlo Ancelotti or for the City legend who is now Bayern's coach, Vincent Kompany.\n\"We deserve it,\" said Guardiola of City's play-off fate. \"I don't know if they are happy to play against us but it is what it is. No complaints. We're going to face them - one is the king of the competition, the other is the second or third.\"\nThe defeats City suffered against Juventus, Sporting and Paris St-Germain, along with the collapse against Feyenoord to draw after leading 3-0 with 16 minutes left, will offer all the encouragement their next opponents need.\nAnd even if these formidable hurdles are overcome, City will then face Diego Simeone's nuggety Atletico Madrid or Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16.\nEasier? Not by much.\nThis video can not be played\nOrdonez own goal gives Man City lead over Brugge\nEven in victory here, City were too often vulnerable on the counter-attack, with too many spaces in midfield for Club Brugge to exploit, but they dug deep when it mattered and clawed themselves out of the hole they were in.\nCity will somehow have to fashion a vast improvement in the short period between this win and the play-offs if they are not to slip out at that stage.\nThis was unthinkable at the start of the season given their pedigree, but it has become very thinkable in recent weeks, especially after the fearful going over they got whenlosing 4-2 in Paris.\nGuardiola, relieved as well as pleased, is hoping City will soon be in a stronger position, able to call on new forward Omar Marmoush among others, while history is littered with teams who turned early struggles into Champions League triumph.\nJohn Stones made a welcome return, while Guardiola is hoping others such as Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake could be back, along with Oscar Bobb, while Kevin de Bruyne can acquire more minutes and fitness.\nGuardiola can also call on the memories of beating Bayern and Real on their way to Champions League final victory against Inter Milan in Istanbul in 2023.\n\"It might seem impossible today, but tomorrow the mindset, the vibes will change,\" Guardiola said. \"We will try against Real or Bayern. We will create problems. These players have something special. We will try to do it.\"\nIt was almost the talk of an underdog, rarely Manchester City's station in recent years.\nThis is where they stand now in this tournament - but when a team of proven quality have a fighting chance, then can defy the odds.\nCity, however, will have to climb several levels if this painful, tortuous Champions League journey is to continue in the last 16.\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola plants a kiss on Savinho after his goal helped them into the Champions League play-offs with victory over Club Brugge\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola smiles after his team reach the Champions League play-offs with victory over Club Brugge\nErling Haaland congratulates Savinho after his goal helped Manchester City to victory over Club Brugge in the Champions League\nChampions League Debrief: Man City survive scare & Villa Park bedlam\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "text": "Counting is under way for nominees to Seanad Éireann (the upper house of the Irish parliament) on Thursday.\nOne of the hopefuls is Sinn Féin Minister Conor Murphy, who madethe announcement of his intention to run and quit Stormont if elected last month.\nThis means those from Northern Ireland will be keeping a closer eye on the results from Dublin than in previous elections.\nThe Seanad holds 60 members, 11of them are nominated by the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and 49 are elected.\nIt sits Leinster House in Dublin, the same building as Dáil Eireann (lower house).\nThe National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin elect three each while the rest are elected to represent \"vocational\" panels by members of the Dáil, councillors and outgoing senators.\nTechnically, there are no political parties within the Seanad, as each person is said to be there independently; however, they divide into groups when it comes to voting on government business.\nOne senator takes on the position as Cathaoirleach (Speaker).\nLike in the Dáil, the Cathaoirleach chairs proceedings and must act impartially.\nThe main function of Seanad Éireann is to vote on or amend legislation.\nBills can start and end in the Seanad as well as in the Dáil.\nHowever, the Dáil has the power to override the Seanad's rejection of a bill.\nThe Seanad can also take part in the removal of the president from office or a judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, or High Court.\nIt also has input on declaring a state of emergency.\nTo become a senator, you must be a citizen of Ireland and over 21.\nThose disallowed from becoming a member of the Seanad include:\nMurphy will be hoping to join a long list of people from Northern Ireland who have sat in the Seanad.\nFormer deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party Seamus Mallon was nominated to the Seanad by then-Taoiseach Charles Haughey in 1982, holding the position of senator between May and December of that year.\nBrian Friel is remembered by most as one of the greatest playwrights of his generation, but he also sat as a senator.\nFriel was nominated by Haughey in 1987 and held the position for two years.\nWriter and broadcaster Sam McAughtry was born in the predominantly Protestant Tiger's Bay area of Belfast.\nIt would seem unlikely that he would sit on the Seanad.\nHowever, the trade union representative and a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party became the first person from Northern Ireland to be elected rather than appointed as a senator in 1996.\nIn 2014,Máiría Cahill waived her legal right to anonymity relating to claims of sexual abusein the BBC Northern Ireland documentary 'Spotlight – A Woman Alone With the IRA'.\nThe story was reported extensively in the media and debated in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Houses of the Oireachtas.\nCahill was elected as a senator in November 2015.\nThis is often noted as the most confusing part of the Seanad operation.\nThe Seanad election must take place up to 90 days after Dáil Éireann has dissolved.\nThis means that the new Dáil is formed before the Seanad election.\nForty-nine of the Seanad's 60 members are elected, and 11 are nominated by the taoiseach.\nHowever, not everyone in Ireland can vote for the 49 elected members.\nForty-three are elected from panels of candidates representing specified vocational interests.\nThe panels are cultural and educational, agricultural, labour, industrial, and commercial and administrative.\nCandidates for panels are selected by nominating organisations or by members of the incoming Dáil or outgoing Seanad.\nThe following people may vote in an election of panel members:\nThe remaining six members are elected by university graduates of Trinity College Dublin and the National University of Ireland.",

    "text": "Work is to begin on an unused and incomplete road in Swindon.\nThe Southern Connector Road runs from just north of the Commonhead roundabout to South Marston village.\nBut in September 2023, Buckingham Group went into administration as the road was due to be completed, and before it was handed over to the council.\nThe administrators wanted the council to pay for construction costs, which it was reluctant to do as it was not complete, but now says it will \"press ahead with the remedial repairs\" in order to get it open.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Cabinet member for the environment and transport Chris Watts said: \"Administration is an extremely time-consuming process that has put us in the frankly unacceptable position where we have been unable to get this new road open.\n\"The New Eastern Villages is one of the borough's key strategic housing sites and we need to support the developers so they can begin to build the much-needed homes. This is being frustrated by the administration process.\"\nThe road is supposed to be used by construction traffic for the New Eastern Villages initially and then by residents, who are currently having to use residential roads Merlin Way and Wanborough Road instead.\nMr Watts added: \"We also have a duty to local residents to get this road opened for construction traffic.\n\"Enough is enough. I have instructed officers to press ahead with the remedial repairs we need to make in order to safely open the road for construction traffic only in the medium term.\"\nMr Watts was unwilling to say how much the repairs might cost, but admitted: \"It won't be cheap.\"\nHe said there were issues with the road and in particular the bridge over some of the streams which cross the low-lying land, and parts of the paths are starting to crumble.\nMr Watts said: \"There's very little that's right with it, but we can't wait any longer, so we're going to fix it, and then try and get the money back.\"\nFollow BBC Wiltshire onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "tags": "",
    "text": "Brands including Dior, Chanel and Armani Privé showcased their new collections at a high-profile Haute Couture Week in Paris, with their shows attracting a host of global celebrities.\nChanel's show was unsurprisingly star-studded, with Dua Lipa, Lily-Rose Depp and Kylie Jenner dressed in signature styles from the fashion house's archives.\nBlackpink's Jennie Kim was among the other A-list onlookers at the Grand Palais.\nOver on the runway, the offering was a perfect spring palette of creams and pinks, with plenty of nods to classic Chanel tweed.\nThe show was a celebration of the fashion house's 110 years in haute couture, using huge ramps that aerially displayed the double C motif of the brand.\nCreated by Chanel's in-house team of designers (new creative director Matthieu Blazy won't be exhibiting his first collection until later this year), it took inspiration from Coco Chanel's 1980s colour palette.\nMegan Thee Stallion had one of the week's most eye-catching looks, a retrofuturistic fusion she described as \"primitive space Cleopatra\".\nHer outfit was made from cascading silver chains, whichWWD saidwere inspired by \"payals\", a type of ankle jewellery traditionally worn to ward off evil spirits. Designer Gaurav Gupta said the US rapper's outfit \"embodies the spirit of tribal India\".\nAt Christian Dior's show, Anya Taylor-Joy and Jenna Ortega opted for gothic but daring looks.\nArtistic vision and craftsmanship are what separate haute couture from high fashion, and both were on display on the Christian Dior runway.\nMaria Grazia Chiuri's collection was said to draw inspiration from Alice in Wonderland, with much of the designs looking like they belonged to the fantasy world.\nThe show was described by many as dramatic - with dresses that more closely resembled lampshades, complete with delightful feathers, tassels and tulle.\nChiuri said the collection was a result of her recent research into historical fashion.\nAlso borrowing from history was Valentino's haute couture show, which was one of the most anticipated events of the week.\nAway from the from springtime pastels and prints, Alessandro Michele's debut couture collection was full of clashing colours and harlequin print fit for a court jester.\nMichele, whose prominence grew after a stint designing for Gucci, is known for his love of accessories - whether hats, bows or out-there embroidery.\nThe stand-out design was a chiffon ballgown that reportedly took the fashion house 54 days to make.\nTo add to the spectacle, half of the models were over 50. \"Time provides grace and it multiplies beauty,\" Michele said of the decision.\nAge was also no barrier for 90-year-old Giorgio Armani, who walked the runway in a black velvet tuxedo to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of his haute couture atelier Armani Privé.\nThe show's main guest was Oscar best actress nominee Demi Moore, who collected her Golden Globe award in a dress by the designer last month.\nArmani's show followed on from the feeling of the fantastical that's been present across much of this week, with embellishments aplenty.\nTrouser suits were donned with sequins, while glittery beanies and diamond-encrusted clutch bags were also a highlight.\nArmani said the collection was for \"a modern woman who has travelled widely and internalised her experiences\".\nNordic style is easy to wear – and can even cheer us up, say its fans. As Copenhagen Fashion Week approaches, we explore the fun, functional Scandi-girl style movement.\nWith the rise of the ready-for-anything, giant tote, and the recent popularity of a Birkin dupe, we look at the evolution of the It bag and ask what our choice of bag reveals.\nMonthly \"swishing\" events in York attract up to 150 people keen to scour the rails for a new look.\nToscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1990s including a priest and nun kissing.\nWhile schoolyard chat turns to the prom, one 15-year-old worries about finding a dress that fits.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "An escaped pet alligator, a chipped tooth and a finger stuck in a beer bottle were just some of the bizarre 999 calls made to the Welsh Ambulance Service in the past year.\nOf the 426,116 calls to the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust (WAST) during 2024, more than 63,000 (15%) were not a life-or-death emergency.\nThat is an average of 175 inappropriate calls to the service every day.\nThe trust has previously warned 999 timewasters put other people's lives at risk.\nWAST has introduced a new process whereby paramedics or nurses in the control room will assess calls and ensure patients get the \"most appropriate\" help.\nAndy Swinburn, trust executive director, said: \"Our emergency ambulance service exists for those whose life is in imminent danger.\n\"That's people in cardiac arrest, those with chest pain or breathing difficulties, loss of consciousness, choking, severe allergic reactions, catastrophic bleeding or someone having a stroke.\n\"Most people know the difference between an emergency and something that is just uncomfortable or irritating but not life-threatening, so if you don't need that time-critical intervention, it's really important to apply common sense and make the right call.\"\nHowever, one person wanted an ambulance because they were locked out of their house, while another called 999 for a toenail cutting mishap.\nThe trust has released the transcripts of some of the most inappropriate calls received by its call handlers.\nOperator: Is the patient awake?\nCaller: Yeah, it's an alligator.\nOperator: Pardon?\nCaller: It's a pet alligator. It's got loose and I'm scared to death. I don't like it. I do not like it. I think it's under the sofa.\nOperator: Right, OK, we won't be able to send an ambulance for an alligator that's escaped.\nCaller: Right, so unless I get bit?\nOperator: Unfortunately, we can't send an ambulance for an alligator. Perhaps you can ring your vet?\nCaller: Hi, the bracelet is on my wrist and I can't take it off. It's so tight.\nOperator: Is your breathing normal for you?\nCaller: Yeah, I'm breathing normal but I'm still suffering.\nOperator: You're suffering?\nCaller: Yeah. How much will the ambulance cost?\nOperator: It doesn't cost anything.\nCaller: It's free, right?\nCaller: I'm locked out of the house and I'm trying to get in.\nOperator: So, what's the reason for the ambulance?\nCaller: I'm cold and I'm trying to get into the house.\nOperator: Is the patient awake?\nCaller: Oh yeah, there's no problem with that. It's just she needs to be treated on her hand.\nOperator: Is she breathing?\nCaller: No problem with all that, it's a hand injury that needs sorting out.\nOperator: How did this happen?\nCaller: We were practising kung fu.\nIn response to the number of non-emergency requests, the trust has introduced rapid clinical reviews of all calls.\nBut Executive Director of Operations Lee Brooks added: \"We still need the public to take ownership of their health and wellbeing at a time when NHS services are stretched beyond measure.\"\nPeople are being urged to use the NHS 111 Wales website, visit GPs or local pharmacists as well as minor injuries units if they are not seriously ill or injured, or there is no immediate threat to life.\nCQC adds that concerns raised about Yormed's ambulance station are 'unsubstantiated'.\nPeter Towndrow did not get to hospital until his son drove him in, despite his wife calling 999.\nWiltshire and Bath Air Ambulance says it saw a 15 percent increase in call outs last year.\nLondon Ambulance Service says this winter is proving to be \"extraordinarily challenging\".\nJeremy Miles says despite \"significant planning\" there were more flu cases than predicted.",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "Scottish Rugby",
    "text": "Alex Williamson did not seek out Mark Dodson for advice before taking on the job as Scottish Rugby's new chief executive, but he seems to have learned some lessons from his predecessor, such as not coming out the gate with eye-catching statements of intent.\nShortly after taking charge in 2011, Dodson set out a four-year strategy that included winning a Six Nations Grand Slam and the Rugby World Cup.\nWilliamson, on first impressions, is a character in stark contrast to the bullish Dodson. In his first session with the media he was keen to lay out an ambitious plan for the union, minus the any proclamations of world domination.\n\"I think we can be highly influential on the international stage,\" Williamson said on the BBC's Scotland Rugby Podcast.\n\"We can be very competitive from a playing perspective. I think our pathways can be good. And we can be outstanding at delivering the on-day experience, whether that be men's, women's, young players, or for just entertainment purposes.\n\"And if you can get all of those together, why can't you be the leading union? It doesn't mean you're necessarily winning the World Cup, but it does mean that you're recognised around the world as being absolutely top-drawer at what you do. And that's kind of what I'm after.\"\nWilliamson describes himself \"relatively low ego\" and confirmed his pay packet will be lower than the exorbitant salary and bonuses pocketed by his predecessor that so infuriated Scottish rugby fans.\nHaving been in the job just over a week, the CEO is still getting is feet under the table, but knows the big challenges awaiting in his in-tray.\nRevamping Murrayfield is high on the list. Whether that is transforming the stadium and campus for sporting and cultural events to grow revenue, or simply sorting the more mundane and urgent priorities like fixing the toilets.\nIt all comes at a cost, and for a union that posted a £11.3m loss in their last set of published accounts, it is a challenge.\n\"We're not going to be able to do Murrayfield in one [go]. But sensible levels, as in fix stuff that doesn't work, and drive things that are going to improve our revenues, that's all do-able,\" Williamson said.\nSorting the business side of the operation is what Williamson has brought in to do, but what fans want to see is successful clubs and national team.\nThe strong sense is that performance director David Nucifora – \"the big brain rugby IP that Scottish rugby needs\", as Williamson describes him – has been given the keys to the entire rugby operation and the big decisions relating to on-field matters will rest with him.\nUpgrading Murrayfield, financing the national sides and pro teams, diverting resources to the pathway, all against a brutally tough financial backdrop – Williamson has a big job on his hands.\nAlex Williamson has just started his role as chief executive of Scottish Rugby",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez has been sentenced to 11 years in prison, following his conviction on bribery and corruption charges.\nLast July, a jury found Menendez guilty on 16 counts for accepting gifts, including gold bars, cash and a Mercedes-Benz, in exchange for helping foreign governments.\nProsecutors were seeking at least a 15-year sentence, citing in court documents the \"rare gravity\" of the ex-senator's crimes.\nLawyers for Menendez, 71, had called for a shorter sentence paired with community service.\n\"Somewhere along the way, you became, I'm sorry to say, a corrupt politician,\" US Judge Sidney Stein said before handing down Menendez's sentence, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nBefore receiving his sentence, Menendez cried while addressing the courtroom.\n\"Other than family, I have lost everything I ever cared about,\" he said, according to court reporters. \"Every day I'm awake is a punishment.\"\nHe then asked the judge \"to temper your sword of justice with the mercy of a lifetime of duty\".\nMenendez's son, Rob Menendez, a Democratic congressman, and his daughter, MSNBC anchor Alicia Menendez, were seated in court behind their father.\nEarlier on Wednesday, two of Menendez's co-conspirators were sentenced in the case.\nFred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer who prosecutors say delivered gold and cash to the senator, was given a sentence of seven years in prison and fined $1.75m (£1.4m).\nWael Hana, an Egyptian-American businessman, who prosecutors say brokered a deal between Menendez and the Egyptian government, received more than eight years in prison and was fined $1.25m.\nMenendez has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has said he plans to appeal the guilty verdict.\nThe New Jersey senator, who used to lead the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, resigned from the upper chamber in August.\nThe guilty verdict came after a nine-week trial, during which jurors saw evidence that Menendez accepted gifts including gold bars worth over $100,000 and more than $480,000 in cash, found by FBI agents inside Menendez's home.\nIn exchange for the bribes, prosecutors said Menendez helped secure millions of dollars in US aid for Egypt.\nHis lawyers argued the gifts did not qualify as bribes, saying prosecutors failed to prove Menendez took any actions as a result of the bribes.\nThe former senator was also convicted for trying to influence criminal probes involving his two co-defendants, Hana and Daibes.\nA third businessman involved in the case, Jose Uribe, has pleaded guilty and is expected to be sentenced later this year. He testified against Menendez during the trial.\nNadine Menendez, the ex-senator's wife, has also been accused of acting as a participant in the scheme by shuttling messages and bribes between the three men and Egyptian officials.\nHer trial was delayed so she could undergo breast cancer treatment and will begin in March. She has pleaded not guilty.\nThe collision between a passenger plane and a military helicopter is suspected to have killed all 67 onboard.\nSixty-seven people are believed to have died in Wednesday's disaster, which is being investigated.\nThe victims of the mid-air collision include dedicated flight attendants and talented ice skaters.\nIf the US imposes import taxes as the president has threatened, its neighbour is mulling a range of targeted responses.\nThey include two teenage athletes, their mothers and two former Russian stars, according to their club in Boston.",

    "text": "When Sharna Matthews found out her lung cancer was terminal, she turned to music to process her feelings.\nMrs Matthews, who performs covers with her husband Jim at small venues in West Yorkshire, said recording her own funeral song had helped her to \"deal with the hurt\" of leaving loved ones behind.\nHer song Think Of Me Again was produced by professional musicians at Leeds-based charity The Swan Song Project, which creates musical legacies for people nearing the end of their lives.\nMrs Matthews, 47, said her diagnosis was a \"smack in the face\" but that creating her swan song had helped her to \"make sense of it all\".\n\"Going through this process has really helped me to understand and express how I'm feeling,\" she said.\n\"It's going to be played at my funeral, but I want it to be positive and uplifting because that's who I am.\"\nMrs Matthews, from Tingley, received hospital treatment for pneumonia and septicaemia in May last year, before finding out that she had stage 4 lung cancer.\nShe was referred to Macmillan Cancer Support by nurses, and said it helped her to \"think about living rather than dying\".\nMrs Matthews' song is a parting gift to her loved ones, with the lyrics describing the important and joyous moments in her life, such as travelling in her blue camper van   with her family.\nThe chorus includes a message to remember good times:\n\"You'll see me in the clouds, the wind and the rain,\n\"Remember the joy, don't sink in the pain...\"\nHer husband Jim said he had been playing the song constantly.\n\"It's on when I'm driving and I just love singing along,\" he said.\n\"But it's going to be hard to listen to when she's not here and I can't think about that yet.\"\nThe Swan Song Project was founded in 2017 by Ben Buddy Slack, a singer-songwriter from Leeds who came up with the idea after his grandmother died.\nHe said they had loved singing together and that he regretted not recording her voice.\nHe wanted to give everyone in the same position the chance to create their own original song, even if they have never sung before.\n\"The dream is that this just becomes the norm,\" he said.\n\"Like when you die you leave a will so why not leave a swan song as well?\"\n\"People can say 'have you heard my mum's swan song?' and what a beautiful way it would be to remember them.\"\nMr Slack, who plays guitar in Mrs Matthews' song, said working with her had been a privilege.\n\"It's been a fast track to friendship because we sat down and got everything out that was important in her life,\" he said.\n\"Part of the death anxiety people have when they find out they don't have long left is 'do my family know how much I love them?'\n\"So when they come here and we can help them put that together into something permanent it's very special.\"\nThe charity works with nine hospices across Yorkshire and has helped more than 170 people going through end-of-life care to compose and record their own songs.\nMr Slack said when he started the project eight years ago it was just him and his guitar, but now he can call on musicians from many different genres to create songs in any style.\n\"We are doing something unique and whether you think you can sing or not we can help you make your swan song for the people you love,\" he said.\n\"Sometimes when people come they say 'I've not had a very special life' but they're always wrong.\n\"Everyone's had an interesting life and we find that for them and it helps them through a really difficult time.\"\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line.\nListen to highlights fromWest Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look Northor tell us a story you thinkwe should be covering here.\nFan Daniel Grace was one of three teenagers killed in crash in West Bretton, near Wakefield.\nLeeds City Council had planned to cut down the tree on Friday morning, ahead of repair work.\nLeeds City Council will close its bereavement service for young people to save money.\nThe charity Race Against Blood Cancer is looking for a match for 21-year-old Marshall Davies.\nPC Marcus Newbold, 29, is charged with seven offences against a girl under 13.",

He was arrested in October 2020.\nDuring the TRA's misconduct hearing, the panel ruled that Cosburn's actions had been \"calculated and motivated\".\nIt also concluded the seriousness of Cosburn's offending was relevant to his ongoing suitability to teach, and \"raised obvious and significant public and child protection concerns\".\nThe panel said Cosburn would not be allowed to appeal against the ban at any point in the future.\nFollow Norfolk news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.",

    "tags": "",
    "text": "A man who claimed bosses at Liverpool football club had rejected his job application due to racial discrimination has had his case thrown out by a tribunal.\nAsad Farooq had applied for the \"high-pressure\" role of first team operations officer, which involved supporting the day-to-day activities of the team in November 2022.\nMr Farooq, from Birmingham, was not shortlisted for interview and later claimed \"unconscious bias\" against his British Asian heritage meant he was not taken seriously.\nHowever, Liverpool successfully argued that his application was dismissed simply due to his lack of experience – and told the tribunal there was \"no evidence whatsoever that race played any part at all\".\nThe club said it had received 487 applications for the position, 444 of which were considered before the list was reduced further into a manageable shortlist.\nThe tribunal had heard the hiring manager, head of first team operations Louise Dobson, initially rejected Mr Farooq's application due to his salary demands but the process was re-opened again when the first candidate the club selected turned the job down.\nOn the second \"sift\" through the applications Mr Farooq, who was working in a temporary job managing a catering contract at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, was once again turned down due to his lack of experience in operational first team roles.\nDelivering a majority ruling at Liverpool Civil and Family Court, employment judge Nicola Benson said: \"The majority view is that the evidence is clear.\n\"At the stage she carried out the shortlisting again, with the intent to reduce the number of 444 applications to a more manageable number, there are no facts or inferences from which we could conclude it had anything to do with the claimant's race.\"\nOne of the two magistrates sitting with Judge Benson however, disagreed and believed Ms Dobson should have taken Mr Farooq forward to the interview stage.\nJudge Benson also said the panel had drawn an inference that Liverpool had declined to provide statistics about the diversity of its roughly 800 strong workforce during the tribunal process because the figures were \"bad\".\nHowever, that decision was taken after the hiring process and had nothing to do with Ms Dobson, she said.\nDuring the tribunal, Ms Dobson said: \"We wanted somebody who was dealing with players, coaching staff, on a day-to-day level.\n\"Someone who was dealing with catering was not what we were looking for.\"\nAnisa Niaz-Dickinson, representing Liverpool, argued that decision was \"reasonable\" and \"untainted\" by racial bias.\nIn her closing submissions she pointed out that three other non-white candidates, including two of mixed Asian and white heritage, had been shortlisted and interviewed for the role.\nDuring the three-day hearing Mr Farooq said he first suspected he had been discriminated against when he saw a post on the Linked In website in May 2023.\nThe post, from a temporary staffer called Anna Garnett with limited experience, wrongly suggested she had been appointed to the first team operations officer role.\nIn fact, the tribunal heard, she had simply been drafted in to cover some basic administrative tasks because the successful candidate, Zac Foley, could not start immediately.\nThe tribunal heard Mr Foley joined from Blackburn Rovers where he had been academy football operations manager and pre-academy manager since 2019.\nMs Dobson said she stood by her hiring decision and Mr Foley is still in the role.\nLiverpool declined to comment after the hearing.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside onBBC Soundsand follow BBC Merseyside onFacebook,X, andInstagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight onBBC iPlayer.",

    "text": "Keira Walsh won Euro 2022 with England\nChelsea have agreed a deal to sign Barcelona's England midfielder Keira Walsh on the Women's Super League's transfer deadline day.\nSources at Barcelona said the total deal was worth up to £800,000, including add-ons. Chelsea sources would not confirm the figures involved but said the basic fee was lower than £800,000.\nBarcelona had been unwilling to sell but it is believed Chelsea's bid was accepted late on Wednesday, and Walsh was due in London for a medical on Thursday.\nThe 27-year-old, who left Manchester City to join Barcelona for a then world record fee of £400,000 in 2022, was keen to return to England to be close to family.\nThe fee is believed to be under theworld record of around £900,000Chelsea paid for USA defender Naomi Girma earlier this month.\nChelsea's interest in Walsh has been long-standing and the club have been looking to bolster their midfield options since the summer.\nWalsh told Barcelona in September that she did not wish to extend her contract, with it due to expire in six months' time.\nArsenal had maintained their interest but Walsh's preference has always appeared to lean towards Chelsea.\nIt is another huge signing for Chelsea with Walsh becoming the second most expensive female footballer in the world.\nDuring her time at Barcelona, Walsh has won back-to-back league titles and the Champions League.\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nIt has been a huge month for Chelsea as they have broken multiple records to sign some of the world's best players.\nThey brought in Girma, widely regarded as the best centre-back in the world, and now Walsh for the two biggest transfer fees in the women's game.\nChelsea have made no secret that their intention is to win the Women's Champions League and they have backed manager Sonia Bompastor to do that.\nDespite featuring for Barcelona in the group stages of the competition, Walsh is eligible to register for Chelsea from the start of the quarter-finals.\nThey remain unbeaten in the WSL with a seven-point lead at the top of the table and are in the fifth round of the Women's FA Cup and the semi-finals of the Women's League Cup as they chase a quadruple.\nBy signing Walsh they have found cover for injured midfielder Sophie Ingle, who has missed the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, as well as taken a key player away from European rivals Barcelona.\nWalsh was always keen to return home having felt like she had achieved all she could in Barcelona and it means she will be close to family in the build-up to Euro 2025.\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "This article contains spoilers about Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy\nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy has been billed as the fourth and final film in the series - but its star Renée Zellweger says she has her \"fingers crossed\" that is not the case.\nZellweger has played our favourite hapless heroine for more than 20 years and seems as attached to her as ever, calling the character an \"old friend\".\nSpeaking at the film's premiere in London's Leicester Square on Wednesday evening, the actress says she is \"in denial\" and \"it hasn't sunk in yet\" that the franchise may be coming to a close.\n\"Let me live in denial for a little longer\", she laughs.\nYet, while there are no plans to take the Bridget Jones story any further, author Helen Fielding is not completely ruling out the prospect.\nThe new film sees Bridget living as a widow, becoming a single mother and tackling modern dating.\nThe story is partially inspired by Fielding's own loss. Her husband, Kevin Curran, died in 2016.\nZellweger says the film is a \"beautiful story and really the most personal for Helen. She is sharing about her own experiences about loss, grief and finding new happiness, it's a pretty special one\".\nShe adds she has always felt \"really, really lucky to get the part\" and \"was just trying not to get fired\".\nIt is obvious there is a real love between the cast too as Zellweger and her on screen father, Jim Broadbent, embrace on the pink carpet.\nHugh Grant was also at the premiere. Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy sees the return of Grant's roguish anti-hero, Daniel Cleaver.\nHe was declared dead at the start of the last film, Bridget Jones's Baby - only to be found alive just before the final credits.\nWe also see a slightly softer side of this notorious womaniser and cad in the new film.\nBut Bridget's love interests in the film are brand new characters.\nOne Day's Leo Woodall plays her Tinder match who at 29 is (cough) a little younger than 51 year old Bridget.\nBafta winner Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a buttoned-up teacher Bridget encounters on the school run and a rain-soaked class trip.\nWoodall says although he felt \"a lot of pressure\" going into the film he knew it was going to be \"relatively easy\" as soon as he met Zellweger as she was \"joyous and generous and kind and good and obviously a wonderful actor\".\nOn whether he has had any clumsy Bridget Jones moments himself, Woodhall says \"he falls over quite a lot\".\nEjiofor, who is mainly known for grittier roles in films like 12 Years a Slave and American Gangster says the film is a \"different speed\" to his usual projects.\nBut adds it was lovely to film: \"Even the set is so warm, everyone is so excited about telling the story\".\nFor Fielding the success of Bridget Jones lies in its \"emotionally honesty\".\n\"When I first wrote Bridget it was an anonymous column in the Independent which I thought would be stopped after six weeks for being too silly,\" she says.\n\"That freed me up to be honest in a way I could never have been otherwise and I think that's what people related to.\n\"I thought I was the only person who felt like that and it turns out for a lot of people there is a huge gap between how you feel you are supposed to be and how you really are.\"\nBridget was a character created in the 1990s and Fielding says she is \"really touched\" that Gen Z have also embraced her.\n\"When I do a signing half the audience are Gen Z's. They're the first generation who have lived through a world crisis for ages. They're very similar to Bridget in their emotional fragility, their ability to share and cry on TikTok.\n\"And they have their same little rituals, Bridget has ice cream and vodka and they have sleep routines and things like that.\n\"I think they're a really interesting and lovely generation. I can't wait until they start writing more novels.\"\nIt has long been rumoured that the book's character of human rights barrister Mark Darcy - played by Colin Firth in the previous Bridget Jones films - was based on barrister turned prime minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nSo is there any truth in this?\n\"All I'll say about that is that if you look at early pictures of Colin in the film and pictures of Keir Starmer in a wig, they're awfully similar,\" Fielding says with a smile.\nSo we may never know that for sure, but could there be another Bridget Jones book and film?\n\"Never say never,\" Fielding adds.\nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is released in UK cinemas on Valentine's Day.\nZhenhao Zou is accused of drugging and raping 10 women at his south London flat, which he denies.\nBetween October and December, outreach teams recorded 4,612 people sleeping rough in the capital.\nThe culprit, Derick Bell, pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and has been jailed for eight weeks.\nPicking up litter while jogging - or plogging - could help save the planet, Vivek Gurav believes.\nMembers were told the club near Tottenham Court Road was due to close in February after being sold to a real estate company.",

    "title": "Brexit: Clarity needed to prevent EU row on NI environmental taxes",
    "category": "other",
    "tags": "",
    "text": "Northern Ireland could provoke a row between the UK and EU over environmental taxes, a business organisation has warned.\nEnergy UK said there needs to be clarity about how the tax known as a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will apply in NI.\nThe UK government says NI will be part of the UK CBAM, which will apply from 2027.\nHowever, Energy UK said the EU is likely to insist that its version of the CBAM applies in NI.\nA CBAM is effectively a carbon or fossil fuel tax on energy-intensive imported goods like steel and fertiliser. The EU's CBAM also applies to imported electricity.\nUK and EU manufacturers have to pay to emit carbon.\nA CBAM is intended to create a level playing field by making sure imported goods are also paying for the carbon emitted in their manufacture.\nEnergy UK said the EU is likely to want its CBAM to apply in NI due to the Windsor Framework, NI's post-Brexit trading arrangement.\nThe framework essentially leaves NI inside the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK is outside.\nThat means goods moving from GB to NI face a range of checks and controls to ensure they meet EU standards.\nEnergy UK said that only by applying the CBAM on goods coming from GB to NI will the EU be able to confirm \"that any goods entering the single market have paid a carbon price\".\nIt added: \"If the UK were to insist that the EU CBAM should not apply in Northern Ireland, this would have serious consequences for the government's 'reset' with the EU and risk reopening the Windsor Framework.\n''A likely consequence of this action would be the imposition of barriers to trade in the form of retaliatory tariffs from the EU.\"\nEnergy UK also believes that even if the government agreed to the EU CBAM applying in NI, it would still create problems by imposing significant new costs on goods and electricity being sold from GB to NI.\nIt said that ultimately the problems could be solved by the UK and EU relinking their system for pricing carbon emissions, a link that was broken by Brexit.\nIt added: \"Linking the EU and UK carbon markets would remove carbon borders between both jurisdictions.\n\"Most importantly, by creating a combined carbon market, the carbon price in the UK and EU will end up becoming the same.\n\"This removes the need for CBAM payments from the UK to EU. With a linked carbon market, the administrative burden of filling in CBAM paperwork will also disappear.\"\nA UK government spokesperson said:  \"Under the terms of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK government and EU agreed to consider linking our respective carbon pricing schemes and to cooperate on carbon pricing.\"\nThis is a complicated and messy policy area which a few years ago could have blown up into a major EU-UK dispute.\nBut there is currently no appetite for that sort of row, and the government seems to be edging towards a solution.\nThat solution is basically alignment with the EU's system for pricing carbon emissions.\n\"Linking our respective systems is absolutely what the ambition is,\" the government's EU point man Nick Thomas-Symonds said last week.\nIf that happens, government critics will say that government policy is a slow drift back into the EU's orbit.\nAt its peak 30% of all premises in Northern Ireland had their power disconnected.\nBut the PM wants to \"make Brexit work better for the British people\", Downing Street says.\nPolice say the man was shot at his home in the Ballygallin Park area of Coleraine on Thursday evening.\nThe education minister says a resolution is \"close\" but a union says negotiations are continuing.\nThe 50-year-old was remanded into custody charged with possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances.",

    "tags": "Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur, Football",
    "text": "We asked for your thoughts afterThursday's Europa League gamebetween Tottenham and Elfsborg.\nHere are some of your comments:\nWilliam:That was so much more like it from Spurs! It was great to see three academy players make their mark, and potentially we have a new plan going forward with Dejan Kulusevski playing off the striker rather than on the wing. After a difficult season. Hopefully, the future is bright!\nEmma:It was very obvious the team were playing with fear. They had nothing in the locker to break the opposition down, who had a low block defensively. The young substitutes came on and played without fear. They brought life into a very dull game and got the crowd singing, as it felt like no one was in the stadium at times. They need to be better in the next round, but they got the job done eventually and that's all you can ask for.\nIan:I think Ange Postecoglou should be far more positive in his demeanour. Instead of complaining about injuries, he should be saying: \"These kids are the future - I wouldn't be picking them if they weren't good enough.\" He should be encouraging the crowd to get behind the kids and stop protesting. The negative atmosphere achieves nothing.\nDaz:And they say \"you can't win anything with kids\"...\nGeorge:Micky van de Ven is irreplaceable. It is so good to see him playing again and making a huge difference to the team.\nAndy:It was great to see Micky van de Ven return as he gives the whole club a boost. Please tell me Manchester City's interest is a rumour! The game was two poor sides, with low confidence, giving it their all. Archie Gray and Mikey Moore were outstanding. The tough games are coming now though and I'm not hopeful.",

I've found myself a job to support my wife and three children and I want the business to continue\".\nA petition calling for Essie Grill to be saved has had hundreds of signatures.\nJoe, a 20-year-old regular, said: \"I'm gutted. Me and a lot of my friends come here quite often. This is the spot for food in Buxton - you only have to look at the reviews.

    "text": "Dane Scarlett's return to the Tottenham team secured his immediate future at the club as he played for Spurs for the first time since pre-season and scored his maiden senior goal for his boyhood club.\nThe 20-year-old's strike during the 3-0 win was important for seeing off Elfsborg, but simply the act of coming on means that he will no longer be able to leave the club - having spent the first half of the season on loan atOxford Unitedin the Championship. Uefa rules prohibit players from appearing for more than two clubs in the same season.\n\"We had a look at his situation,\" manager Ange Postecoglou explained after the match. \"He has had a couple of disappointing loans. I think sending him out again without any sort of real prospect of him developing, we just felt to keep him training with us and give him an opportunity to play and see how it goes.\"\nSweden forward Dejan Kulusevski enjoyed Scarlett's performance and was in an upbeat mood after the game.\nSpurs are now focused on ending the season well while still in the Europa League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup.\n\"I love Dane Scarlett a lot,\" Kulusevski said. \"I think he is a great player and I believe he will help us these months. It was a great goal so I'm very happy for him. Also the other players that scored, they have to give the energy now. We have a lot of injuries and they did an amazing job today.\n\"A lot of players are coming back from injury now, like Micky [van de Ven], who is a world class centre-back. I believe we still can do it [win a trophy].\"\nScarlett's return to the squad will have an impact on talented striker Will Lankshear, 19, who is exploring his loan options in the Championship and in Europe.\nLankshear has been linked with a move toBurnley,Middlesbrough,West Brom,CardifforLuton.\nThe idea was that if no players got injured in attack then he would be cleared to move with four days left to secure that switch.\nMeanwhile, Spurs have refused to confirm that they have had a £50m bid accepted for wide forward Mathys Tel, 19, but widespread reports and sources in Germany insist that it is true.\nHowever, many of those same reports also suggest that Tel himself has not accepted the move - as he awaits further offers before deadline day - which might explain the cautiousness in north London.",
