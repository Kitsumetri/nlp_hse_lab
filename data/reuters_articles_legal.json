        "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump 's sweeping assertions of executive power during his first weeks back in office appear headed toward U.S. Supreme Court showdowns, but it remains an open question whether or how much the justices might act to check his authority. Since taking office on January 20, Trump's views of presidential authority appear far less restrained than those of his White House predecessors, according to legal scholars, citing actions such as seeking to restrict birthright citizenship, withholding funding appropriated by Congress and removing heads of independent federal agencies."

Republican President Donald Trump has used his early days in office to shrink, purge and remake the U.S. federal government, and federal agency heads have been asked to identify employees on probationary periods , or who have served less than two years. Such employees are easier to fire."

The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed strong wage growth last month, with average hourly earnings surging by the most in five months, which should keep consumer spending supported. Labor market resilience is the driving force behind the economic expansion."

Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, laid out priorities ahead of annual climate talks in November, and encouraged countries to prepare stronger national climate plans this year, even after U.S. President Donald Trump said he will remove the world's second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter from the Paris agreement."

On the face of it, Thursday’s decision by $9 billion BPER (EMII.MI) , opens new tab to lob in a $4.5 billion all-share bid , opens new tab for domestic peer Banca Popolare di Sondrio (BPSI.MI) , opens new tab (BPSO) merely represents the latest iteration of a wider saga in which other deals – like UniCredit’s (CRDI.MI) , opens new tab 10 billion euro swoop for Banco BPM (BAMI.MI) , opens new tab and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena’s (BMPS.MI) , opens new tab (MPS) 13 billion euro pitch for Mediobanca (MDBI.MI) , opens new tab – are more eye-catching. Yet BPER Chief Executive Gianni Franco Papa’s gambit also inserts him in the conversation should these other deals unravel. The three Italian bank M&A situations share certain characteristics. UniCredit boss Andrea Orcel gave BPM shareholders only a 0.5% premium, and MPS offered a 5% uplift. Now BPER is proposing a mere 6.6% bump to its target’s investors relative to its share price on Wednesday. The flipside in each case is the chance to share in the chunky synergies you’d expect in a domestic merger. BPER’s 190 million euros of cost savings should be worth 1.3 billion euros taxed and capitalised, and Jefferies analysts see the targeted level as conservative."

The decision complicates a proposed sale of Jones' Infowars platform, and could spur divisions between families who sued Jones and won nearly $1.3 billion in Connecticut court cases and those who won $50 million in Texas courts. The two groups of families had proposed a settlement that would guarantee the Texas families a 25% share of Jones' future payments made to the Sandy Hook families, with the Connecticut families taking 75%."

Then-CEO John Browne’s attempt to embrace lower-carbon energy came to nought, and 20 years later so did a similarly quixotic gambit by another now-ex boss, Bernard Looney. In 2025, Looney’s own successor Murray Auchincloss may examine the cards he’s been dealt and conclude that a more apt slogan for the $85 billion group is “Best Partitioned”. Since Auchincloss took over in January 2024, BP shares have fallen 11%, while rivals like $201 billion Shell (SHEL.L) , opens new tab and $483 billion Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab grew. The upshot is BP trades at a palpable discount to peers: based on 2025 free cash flow of $11.8 billion, per analyst forecasts compiled by Visible Alpha, BP yields 14%. That makes it cheap compared to Shell’s 13% and Exxon Mobil’s 6%. It also trades at around 3 times 2025 EBITDA, versus Shell’s 4 times and Exxon’s 7 times."

The move, part of attempts to lighten the regulatory burden on businesses in the 27-member bloc, could exempt tens of thousands of companies from the world-first carbon border fee."

The BoE halved its 2025 growth outlook - a blow for finance minister Rachel Reeves who is pushing to speed up the economy - and said inflation would be almost double its 2% target this year. Governor Andrew Bailey said he thought that would prove to be a \"bump in the road\" before inflation falls back."

Shortly after tariffs on China imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump took effect on Tuesday, China's Finance Ministry said it would impose levies of 15% on imports of U.S. coal and LNG and 10% for crude oil as well as on farm equipment and some autos, starting on Feb. 10."

China imposed targeted tariffs on U.S. imports on Tuesday and put several companies, including Google, on notice for possible sanctions, in a measured response to Trump's tariffs."

        "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Simplicity is hard. For all the breezy and cavalier rhetoric that pushy investors, bankers and CEOs use to tout the benefits of breaking up companies, such efforts often fail to generate the anticipated or promised results. With a fresh wave of spinoffs in the works, it’s a good time to brush up on some harsh financial realities. Whether for reasons related to ego, pay or simplistic growth, most bosses want to enlarge their empires, not shrink them. It’s also usually easier to buy a peer and hack out costs than it is to extract a business already tangled up inside a bigger enterprise. Although conglomerates have fallen out of favor, the ability to create value over the long term by splitting them into more narrowly focused operations sounds as dubious as the notion of one plus one making three in an acquisition."

Mulino, after the talks with the top U.S. diplomat in Panama City, signaled he would review agreements involving China and Chinese businesses, and announced further cooperation with the U.S. on migration, but reiterated that his country's sovereignty over the world's second busiest waterway is not up for discussion."

After taking office, Trump ordered military and immigration officials to be ready by Feb. 3 to implement the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, last used to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two. The move - which would almost certainly face legal challenges - could allow him to bypass due process rights and rapidly remove migrants."

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the federal workforce and is controlled by the White House, said in a Jan. 28 email , opens new tab to federal employees that workers who submit their resignation by Feb. 6 will retain their full pay and benefits through Sept. 30 without having to show up for work, except in undefined \"rare cases.\" OPM instructed workers willing to submit so-called \"deferred resignations\" to send an email to an agency account with the word \"Resign\" in the subject line."

For many, that made signing up an easy decision - but getting out would be much harder. The Chinese workers hired by BYD contractor Jinjiang in Brazil had to hand over their passports to their new employer, let most of their wages be sent directly to China, and fork over an almost $900 deposit that they could only get back after six months' work, according to a labor contract seen by Reuters."

Inmarsat said in a Wednesday court filing in Delaware that the company's existing lenders are only providing $115 million in new money to Ligado, while the rest of the bankruptcy loan merely refinances its existing debts. The loan adds nearly $100 million in new fees, almost entirely “eating up” the new money and reducing the chance that Ligado’s other creditors, including Inmarsat, will be paid, according to the objection."

        "text": "LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Launching an unwelcome takeover of a rival bank used to be a sign of dangerous excess. These days, it seems to be the most logical option available to would-be acquirers. Three bids and one possible approach are currently on the table in Europe, potentially worth almost 60 billion euros in total, none of which are wanted by the targets. The deals are nothing like the hubristic hostile acquisitions of old, but there’s still a risk that the aggressors will suffer from the winner’s curse. The key players in the current round of European bank M&A are Carlos Torres Vila, chair of 63-billion-euro Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) (BBVA.MC) , opens new tab , and Andrea Orcel, the CEO of 69-billion-euro Italian lender UniCredit (CRDI.MI) , opens new tab . Torres last May launched a 12-billion-euro offer for smaller Spanish rival Banco de Sabadell (SABE.MC) , opens new tab . Later in the year, Orcel snapped up almost 30% of Germany’s 22-billion-euro Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) , opens new tab , partly through derivatives, and made it known that he favours a full acquisition if local authorities agree."

        "text": "Jan 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. solar industry group on Wednesday unveiled an aggressive goal to deploy vast amounts of energy storage capacity by 2030 to help renewables serve power-hungry customers. Large energy users have been investing in nuclear, geothermal and natural gas power plants to meet soaring demand for electricity from data centers. Energy storage, primarily large lithium-ion batteries, can help zero-emitting resources like wind and solar serve those needs by storing power when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing so that it can be used later."

The technology forms a big part of government strategies to advance renewable energy and decarbonize the global power industry because it can generate vast amounts of electricity near densely populated coastal regions. Missing targets by a wide margin will leave a gap that could be hard to fill."

Competition authorities argue it would hurt patients, again going beyond the orthodoxy of using prices as the arbiter of harm. Jonathan Kanter, the agency’s antitrust chief, has targeted UnitedHealth before. The sprawling $545 billion conglomerate is not only the largest U.S. health insurer, but also a hulking claims processor, data analyzer and has 90,000 affiliated or directly employed doctors under its wings. It has expanded its power partly by spending more than $36 billion on acquisitions, including the 2022 takeover of technology-focused Change Healthcare. The DOJ failed in its attempt , opens new tab to stop the transaction."

During the Republican U.S. president-elect's first term, he was infuriated by what he called an obstructive Justice Department, including attorneys general Jeff Sessions, who allowed a probe into alleged contacts between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia, and Bill Barr, who publicly refuted his false claims his 2020 election loss was the result of fraud."

Although cannabis has not been a significant issue this election cycle, several states had ballot questions seeking to codify legalization and included psilocybin among others in addition to cannabis. From legislative changes to market trends, 2024 highlighted both the challenges and opportunities within this rapidly growing sector. In this article, we focus on some of the most significant developments of the past year and how they might affect the industry in the coming years under a new administration whose president-elect has hedged on the issue in the past."

Some Canadian oil industry participants saw Trump's election as a positive that would stimulate energy investment across North America and could boost the value of U.S. dollars that Canadian producers receive for their crude. However, some said any increase in U.S. oil and gas production could raise competition for Canadian exports to other parts of the world."

With just such intentions, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has implemented new regulations to combat corruption that business and real estate professionals may not be aware of, but that their clients need to comply with. A sweeping program — the Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) program — was established under a bipartisan federal law called the Corporate Transparency Act. The law has the stated goal of making it \"harder for bad actors to hide or benefit from their ill-gotten gains through shell companies or other opaque ownership structures\" by forcing companies to disclose the actual human individuals behind them."

Justice Juan Merchan has said he will make his decision by Tuesday. It is the first of two pivotal choices that the judge must make after Trump's Nov. 5 election victory . Merchan also must decide whether to go ahead with sentencing Trump on Nov. 26 as currently scheduled. Legal experts have said sentencing now is unlikely to happen ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration."

From crafting human-like text to predicting complex molecular structures, GenAI is reshaping industries across the globe. As our reliance on GenAI increases, the question of how to protect these innovations has become paramount. While trade secrets will continue to play an important role, recent trends and legal developments suggest that patents may be critical to protecting GenAI innovations. Companies therefore must focus on the GenAI patent landscape in plotting their course. This includes safeguarding their products from competition using their own patents and considering the patent holdings of competitors and others in assessing their freedom-to-operate (FTO)."

The issue failed to drive the turnout the vice president needed, as other topics proved more salient. Just 14% of voters cited abortion as their top issue in the White House race, while 32% cited the economy, an Edison Research exit poll showed."

With Republicans set to take back control of the Senate, which must confirm judicial nominees, Trump should enjoy an easy path to filling possible vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court and the expected 100-plus seats that will likely open up on lower courts across the nation."

Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has said he plans to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement at the start of his second presidency, and his policy advisers have floated removing the U.S. from the underlying UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1992."

Analysts expect up to $55 billion in insured losses from the two major hurricanes. In addition to hurricane damage, insurers have seen a rise in losses from so-called \"secondary perils\" such as storms, hail, wildfires and floods in recent years, which they attribute partly to climate change."

One phenomenon of concern is AI-generated prior art — documents created today by AI tools that may qualify as prior art against inventions for which patent protection is sought in the future. AI-generated prior art is particularly relevant in patent-application preparation, prosecution, and litigation over incremental innovation. Services like IP.com and Google's Technical Disclosure (TD) Commons can generate numerous variations on a technical disclosure, flooding the patent space with publications that may lack experimental data or meaningful structure but still serve as obstacles in patent prosecution."

Trump, 78, clinched Tuesday's election after a polarizing and dizzying campaign marked by two attempts on his life and Kamala Harris' late entry into the race following President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal."

Democratic-backed candidates in Kentucky and Michigan won contests for seats on those states' respective high courts in which reproductive rights were a key issue. But Arizona voters declined to kick two Arizona Supreme Court justices who had upheld an 1864 abortion ban off the bench in a retention election, according to projections from Edison Research."

Republicans were set to hold a majority of at least 52-48 in the U.S. Senate and had added three seats to their 220-212 House of Representatives majority, though with 40 of the 435 races yet uncalled, final control of the lower chamber was still unclear."

Dimon, 68, has been the subject of repeated speculation in recent weeks as a candidate for Treasury secretary by both Republicans and Democrats, but he said last month that his chances of taking an official post were \"almost nil\". Reuters was the first to report his intentions to stay at the helm."

Justices Clarence Thomas , 76, and Samuel Alito , 74, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts , who turns 70 a week after Trump is due to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, all were appointed by Republican presidents to their lifetime posts on the court. All three could decide to retire with the Republican Trump succeeding Democratic President Joe Biden and with Republicans taking control of the Senate, according to legal experts."

Thomas Kwan, 53, passed himself off as a nurse and even took his own mother's blood pressure before administering poison to her then partner Patrick O'Hara in Newcastle, northern England."

Trump, a Republican who defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's presidential election, will inherit an economy that under Democratic President Joe Biden has recently outperformed the rest of the developed world by a hefty margin and has managed to dodge a widely predicted recession even as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates aggressively to rein in the worst inflation since the 1980s."

Following are some major issues and sectors to watch: After some nudging from the world's wealthiest person, Trump has said he would tap Tesla CEO Elon Musk to lead a new government efficiency commission. Musk has said at least $2 trillion could be cut from the $6.75 trillion federal budget. How that works could be a key to the next Trump administration."

ERISA's inception in 1974 followed the infamous failure of the Studebaker pension plan in 1963, which left many workers without promised retirement benefits. Senator Jacob Javits (R-NY), one of ERISA's architects, was primarily concerned with establishing fiduciary protections to prevent such calamities. The statute, designed to safeguard employee benefit plans, provides a regulatory framework and lifeline for workers and their beneficiaries, ensuring their retirement and other health and welfare benefits are legally protected."

With one day to go before the tightly contested U.S. presidential election between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump , lawyers for Musk's pro-Trump America PAC sought to persuade Judge Angelo Foglietta that the contest was not an \"illegal lottery,\" as Philadelphia's top prosecutor alleged."

Oil and gas is Canada's highest-polluting industry and its emissions continue to rise, undercutting progress in many other parts of the economy. Ottawa will likely fall short of its commitment to reduce emissions by 40-45% from 2005 levels by 2030 unless the oil and gas sector intensifies efforts to decarbonize."

        "text": "November 04, 2024 - There is an old adage that in polite company, one does not ask about another person's politics or religion. However, with the advent of pay-to-play rules, such as various federal rules covering certain financial institutions (e.g., SEC Rule 206(4)-5 for investment advisers) and a plethora of state and local laws, a company now has to restrict covered employees from making or soliciting certain political contributions if it wants to continue doing state or local government business. Pay-to-play laws automatically ban a company from entering into contracts or business relationships with a state or local government, in many cases lasting several years, if its covered employees or board members make or solicit certain political contributions in that jurisdiction."

With Trump again the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency, his allies have fired back at this group, named the 65 Project . A pro-Trump nonprofit known as America First Legal has accused the 65 Project of engaging in a left-wing attempt to intimidate conservative lawyers, filing a bar complaint earlier this week against the 65 Project's top lawyer Michael Teter. The Oct. 28 complaint said Teter was targeting lawyers \"based solely upon their representation of a disfavored client.\""

It's a common problem for many Native American voters like Juan. A registered voter on the Tohono O'odham Nation reservation, Juan, like many residents of tribal land, lacks a physical address. Instead, voting records provide a rough description of how to find her home -- it's near milepost 7 on Indian Route 19 and hers was the 53rd home built in Cold Fields Village."

The states brought their lawsuit against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by intervening in a case that was started by anti-abortion doctors and medical groups. By filing in Amarillo, the original plaintiffs had ensured that the case would go to U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a staunch conservative and former Christian activist."

In a letter sent ahead of the final round of negotiations on a U.N. treaty in Busan, South Korea, later this month, New York Attorney General Letitia James and the attorneys general of California, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and others, urged the U.S. delegation to go beyond its stated positions at the talks."

The move was part of an unprecedented and coordinated attempt to save the global banking system from collapse. It also marked the beginning of an overhaul of financial regulation that, a decade and a half later, is still not complete. This week, though, Dimon declared he had had enough of new bank rules. “It is time to fight back,” the 68-year-old, the only one of the nine CEOs from 2008 still in the same job, told the American Bankers Association. “We don't want to get involved in litigation just to make a point, but if you're in a knife fight, you better bring a knife and that's where we are.\""

Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide. That ruling essentially moved the fight over reproductive rights to the states, clearing the way for 13 conservative states to ban abortion and legislatures in others to severely restrict it. It also prompted voters in four states to approve initiatives enshrining abortion rights in state constitutions, with similar measures on ballots in 10 states this year."
