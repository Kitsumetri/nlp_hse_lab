            "tags": "",
            "text": "His devotees call themselves “Potheads,” and they feverishly collect and trade his pottery online. He says he’s just trying to build an ethical brand that benefits his workers and his community - a business model that was put to the test when Hurricane Helene tore through his adopted home here in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\nHe’s Alex Matisse, a potter-turned-businessman whoseEast Fork Potteryis a proud hybrid of art and American manufacturing. And, oh yeah, he’s also the great-grandson of the French painter and sculptor Henri Matisse.\nThe late French artist was known for his expressive use of color. His great-grandson is known for collectible rustic stoneware that often has a distinctive speckled finish.\nMost people who collect East Fork Pottery don’t know who’s behind the brand – or of the connection to the French artist, Matisse says. He doesn’t use his name to market his products, and he has created a quieter, outdoorsy life for himself in the North Carolina mountains, one largely removed from the art world.\n“The vast majority of people who are buying this stuff have no idea. So that’s just one more little layer to this story. East Fork in and of itself is a force. And that’s what I love.”\nMatisse grew up in Massachusetts in a family of artists. After his great-grandfather gained worldwide fame, his grandfather, Pierre, moved from France to New York and became a renowned art dealer – some say he was the most important dealer of his era - who introduced European artists to the American market.\nPierre’s son, Paul Matisse, is Alex’s father and works as an artist and inventor. Alex’s sister, Sophie Matisse, is a painter in New York.\nMatisse says one thing ingrained in family members was not trading on the famous last name of their ancestor.\n“His work was not to be exploited,” Matisse says.\n“It’s an amazing thing that I was born into this family…it’s an interesting legacy. But I’m doing my own thing.”\nMatisse left Massachusetts and went to North Carolina for college, where he planned to pursue an academic path, convinced he did not want to be an artist. But a high school pottery class had left an impression. He ended up dropping out of college and doing an apprenticeship with a potter, and then retreated to an old tobacco farm just north of Asheville to experiment with a wood kiln.\nSoon he’d created a successful business hand-throwing large, decorative pots that furnished hotels and local estates.\nThey sold for around $2400.00. “This is not the art world…We weren’t going to Art Basel…” he says, referring to the international art fair. “This was a very specific niche of North Carolina pottery.”\nAfter making several pieces for Calvin Klein Home he realized there was a mass market for unique, quality pottery.\nIn 2009, East Fork was born. But the new pottery, which had a uniform look and was not wood-fired, cost him some fans.\n“I had a lot of collectors. Then we switched over to what we make now; we lost all those collectors overnight. It felt commercial in the context of what we used to make,” he says.\n“It was so totally different. (Like going) from playing classical music to suddenly doing some avant garde noise music,” Matisse says.\nTo Matisse, East Fork Pottery was always going to be a different kind of company.\n“We were not founded by MBAs,” he says. “We’re all artists.”\nMatisse founded the company with his fellow potter, John Vigeland, and with his now-wife, Connie Matisse, a writer who ran much of the company’s social media. Both are still involved with East Fork Pottery but have stepped away from the day-to-day operations.\nEast Fork specializes in distinctive home goods – especially dining ware – that is expensive enough to be pay its workers a fair wage but still affordable enough to make it accessible to consumers with disposable income.\nThe plates, bowls and mugs come in a wide variety of creatively named colors from Amaro to Lamb’s Ear to Wine Dark Sea.\nThe quality is different from a mass market set of plates “and it feels different in your hand,” says Matisse.\n“We’re proudly a factory but there’s so much handwork,” Matisse says. “There’s craft in everything we do.\nIn North Carolina, where the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, the lowest-paid worker makes $22.10, according to Matisse. East Fork employs about 100 people in Asheville and 115 company-wide.\nMatisse hesitates to disclose revenue numbers but concedes he’d make a lot more if he gave away less to community non-profits or lowered wages, even just a little. “But we’d never do that,” he says.\nTrying to run an ethical business isn’t the easiest way to become profitable but he looks to companies like Patagonia, Dr. Bronner’s and Ben and Jerry’s as business models he admires. A cold call he made to Patagonia’s former CEO was answered just because “she used to be a potter. She has a soft spot there,” he says.\nFlooding from Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville in late September. Even residents who didn’t sustain damage to their property found themselves in a precarious existence without cell service or clean water. It took 53 days for Asheville’s boil water advisory to be lifted.\nEast Fork works out of three buildings in Asheville: a store downtown, a factory located a few blocks from downtown, and an office building in the River Arts District, an area ravaged by Helene’s floodwaters. The office space was ruined and is being rebuilt. The other two buildings didn’t sustain much damage and were back up and running in a couple of weeks.\nRelated articleLife may be slowly returning to normal, but businesses in Asheville still feel the brunt of natural disaster\nAll of East Fork’s employees made it through the hurricane (although several had damage to their homes) and all returned to work.\nTo keep his payroll going after the disaster, Matisse went on social media to ask his customers to buy “seconds” - pottery with slight imperfections that is still usable.\nHe also pledged to donate 5% of all sales to community non-profits working to restore Asheville. Most of the inventory sold out that day, he says.\nIn the wake of Helene, East Fork has opened its Asheville shop to other makers and craftspeople who lost their storefronts. Along with the pottery they always sell, they are now highlighting items from artists across Western North Carolina. “We’ve been in this community for a long time. People come together, people show up for each other.”\nIn the three-and-a-half months since Helene hammered North Carolina, East Fork has raised more than 500-thousand dollars for relief efforts, Matisse says.\n“We want to make a positive impact in the lives of our employees, our community, our customers and the environment,” he says. “It’s not just about what you make, it’s how you make it.”\nThat’s a sentiment that resonates with “Potheads” Glen Blount and Chuck Kaylor, who run the Instagram accounteastforkpotheads, one of more than 50 active fan pages for East Fork’s pottery.\nThey describe their first experience going to an East Fork sale as “kinda like Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. It was love at first sight.”\nThey fell in love with the colors, they say, but what turned them into “potheads” was the people – East Fork’s potters and also their fellow collectors.\nThe couple line up hours early for pop-up sales at locations across the Southeast, where they mingle with other fans, often bringing a mini speaker to play music. “For us, it’s a big party,” says Blout. “We get to hang out with people who love it, talk about this year’s glazes, we speculate about next year’s glazes…”\nPotheads rival Swifties in their devotion and their detective skills. They pore over official East Fork social media posts, looking for Easter eggs that may hint at future colors and collections.\n“Sometimes they drop little nuggets on their instagram page so all the community on Instagram will be like: ‘Did y’all see that?’ says Kaylor.\nAnd then there are the speckles.\nSome collectors believe an abundance of speckles on certain glazes make them more desirable. “Speckles are everything,” Kaylor says of the East Fork trademark. “The more speckles, the better.”\nOlder East Fork Pottery pieces on eBay can go for thousands more than the original price tag.\nFancy a millennial pink popcorn bowl from East Fork’s 2019 collection? That’ll set you back $2500.00 on eBay right now.\nBut it’s East Fork’s focus on community that resonates with Blunt and Kaylor most. “It’s really easy to get behind a company that puts their money where their mouth is and gives back in that way. We’re gonna be in their corner even more because they were in our corner, in North Carolina’s corner, when we went through something so tough,” says Kaylor.\nIn recent years East Fork has survived a tough economy, Covid, and now Hurricane Helene. Each time, loyal customers like Blount and Kaylor have kept the brand going.\nEast Fork even expanded in December, opening a store in Brooklyn. It joins two other brick and mortar shops in Asheville and Atlanta.\nMatisse says his focus now is getting the company stable and profitable. “The last couple of years have been really hard,” he admits. “We’ve also endured. A lot of companies have come and they’ve gone away. We’ve endured.”"

            "text": "A commercial passenger plane bound for Reagan National Airportcollided with aUS Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River just outside of Washington, DC, on Wednesday. There were 64 people on board the aircraft and three people in the helicopter. No one is believed to have survived the collision, officialssaidThursday, in what is likely the deadliest aviation disaster in the USsince 2001.The investigation into the tragedy isongoing.\nThrough maps, videos, photos and radio transmissions, CNN is piecing together what occurred during the deadly, midair collision. Here is a timeline of what we know so far, including new, exclusive videos obtained by CNN:\nAmerican Airlines flight 5342, operated by PSA Airlines, takes off from Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport bound for Washington, DC. It’s scheduled to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, DCA, just before 9 p.m. ET.\nSixty passengers and four crew members were aboard the aircraft, a Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jet manufactured in 2004.\nA US Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying three crew members – from the 12th Aviation Battalion, based out of nearby Fort Belvoir, Virginia – was traveling south over the Potomac River, just east of DCA on Wednesday evening. Its exact origin and takeoff time are unknown to CNN as of Thursday afternoon.\nThe Black Hawk helicopter was on an annual proficiency training flight, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who also confirmed the pilots were experienced and wearing night vision goggles.\nAs American Airlines flight 5342 approaches DCA, it contacts air traffic control about landing on Runway 1. Controllers ask the pilots to use Runway 33 instead. The pilots confirm the change and the aircraft is cleared to land.\nAA Flight 5342:“Tower, Bluestreak 5342 on Mount Vernon visual, Runway 1”\nAir Traffic Control:“Bluestreak 5342 Washington Tower [unintelligible] 320 at 17, gusts 25, Can you take Runway 33?”\nSeveral other instructions are heard, and then:\nAA Flight 5342:“Yeah, we can do 33 for Bluestreak 5342.”\nAir Traffic Control:“Can confirm Runway 33, Runway 33 cleared to land …”\nListen to controller and airline pilot discuss landing clearance\n\nSource: LiveATC.net\nAn air traffic controller contacts the Black Hawk helicopter, flying under the call sign PAT 2-5, to confirm it sees American Airlines flight 5342, which he refers to as a “CRJ,” based on the plane type CRJ-700.\nAir Traffic Control:“PAT 2-5 do you have the CRJ in sight?”\nAir Traffic Control:“PAT 2-5 pass behind the CRJ.”\nHelicopter Pilot:“PAT 2-5 has aircraft in sight, request visual separation.”\nLess than 13 seconds later, an air traffic control transmission captures controllers gasping as the aircraft collide, followed by instructions to reroute other aircraft away from the area. “Oh my,” is also heard from the control room.\nHear all that radio here:\nListen to controller and helicopter pilot discuss 'visual separation'\n\nSource: LiveATC.com\nExclusive videos obtained by CNN show previously unseen angles of the collision between an American Airlines flight and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River on Wednesday night.Editor’s Note:These videos contain sensitive material that may be hard to watch.\nThe air traffic control tower in DC alerts another pilot to what has taken place.\nThe other pilot can be heard saying, “Yeah, we were on short final, and we saw flares from the opposite side of the Potomac.”\nFootage from a security camera at Reagan National airport shows the midair collision:\nDiscussions can be heard among air traffic controllers and other pilots about diverting to other airports, including Washington Dulles International Airport in nearby Loudoun County, Virginia.\nListen to controllers and other pilots discuss aftermath of collision\n\nSource: LiveATC.net\nAn approach controller later says, “Apparently both aircraft involved are in the river, a search and rescue will be ongoing.”\n“Crash, crash crash, this is an alert three,” a dispatcher says in audio obtained by CNN.\nDC Police said it started receiving calls around 8:53 p.m. ET about “an aircraft crash above the Potomac River.”\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the cause of the collision, will take about 30 days to release a preliminary report, and a final report, which will determine a probable cause, will take much longer, itsaid. Still,details about the collision’s circumstancesand potential avenues for the investigation are emerging.\nFlight tracking data from the moments before the fatal midair collision on Wednesday appear to show the Black Hawk helicopter flying above the maximum allowed altitude at times and veering off the prescribed route along the east side of the Potomac River.\nOne step already taken by the Trump administration and FAA is to restrict all helicopters from entering immediate airspace around DCA. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffyshared a mapof the new restrictions on X on Friday.\nCNN’s Pete Muntean, Oren Liebermann, Isaac Yee, Teele Rebane, Avery Schmitz, Sean O’Key, Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Natasha Bertrand, Brad Lendon, Justin Lear, Andy Rose, Lex Harvey and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report."

The plane,flying from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 64 people, while three soldiers were aboard the Army helicopter. Searchers have recovered the plane’s flight data and voice recorders, known as black boxes, which should help investigators in determining the cause of the catastrophe. Just a day before the fatal collision, another flight approaching Reagan National Airport was forced to abort its first landing and go around after a helicopter flew near its flight path,CNN has learned.\nThree of President Donald Trump’s most controversial picks for his Cabinet and key administration roles weregrilled during Senate hearingson Thursday. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel faced sharp questions from Democrats and several Republican lawmakers in what amounted to the most directskepticism from GOP senatorsover Trump’s nominees to date. Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence the three nominees will ultimately be confirmed, though he stressed that securing their approval will require significant effort. If all Democrats oppose Trump’s nominees, they can only afford to lose three GOP senators on the floor to win confirmation.\nThe FDA on Thursday approved the first new type of pain medication in 25 years. The drug, suzetrigine, is a 50-milligram prescription pill that’s taken every 12 hours after a larger starter dose. It will besold under the brand name Journavx. About 80 million Americans fill prescriptions each year for medications to treat new instances of moderate to severe pain, according to astudy by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the company that developed the new drug. About half of those prescriptions are written for opioid medications, which can lead to dependence and addiction. Unlike opioid medications, which dull the sensation of pain in the brain, suzetrigine works by preventing pain-signaling nerves around the body from firing in the first place.\nA sinkhole that suddenly opened on a road near Tokyo has captured international attention as attempts to rescue an elderly truck driver drag on. On Tuesday, part of an intersection in Saitama prefecture, about 18 miles north of Japan’s capital,swallowed a three-ton truck and its driver, a 74-year-old man. The rescue mission is now in its fourth day. Authorities believe that corroded sewer pipes may have caused the earth to fall in. Leaking wastewater may have further eroded the soil, widening the chasm, they said. Japanese authorities have asked hundreds of residents to evacuate as the sinkhole has grown more than 40 meters wide, or about 130 feet.\nTwo benefit concerts collectivelyreferred to as FireAidtook place in Los Angeles on Thursday to support relief efforts in the wake of this month’s deadly wildfires.

            "text": "The American Airlines flight involved in the deadly collision with a Black Hawk helicopter over Washington, DC, seemed to increase its pitch just before the impact, preliminary data from a data recorder recovered from the plane shows.\n“At one point very close to the impact, there was a slight change in pitch, an increase in pitch,” National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said at a Saturday evening news conference. “That is something that we will get you more detail on.”\nThe finding is one of the first pieces of information that have emerged as the NTSB works to investigate the disaster in which 67 people are thought to have been killed. The Black Hawk helicopter was training to evacuate government officials in the event of a catastrophe when the collision with the passenger jet occurred.\nThe agency is still working to transcribe the entirety of the audio from voice recorders, Brice Banning, the NTSB investigator-in-charge, said.\nPreliminary data announced at the news conference indicate that the helicopter may have been flying above the altitude allowed in the corridor. Initial data shows the American Airlines regional plane was flying at around 325 feet, plus or minus 25 feet, at the time of the impact, according to Inman.\nBut the data available to the air traffic controllers showed the helicopter was at 200 feet near the time of the accident, Inman said, an unexplained discrepancy they will need to investigate further.\nIf the impact did take place at 325 feet, it would have been well above the 200-feet limit to which helicopters are restricted in the corridor. The helicopter was using specialized corridors for law enforcement, medevac, military and government helicopters in the Washington area. Federal Aviation Administration charts show and the NTSB confirmed helicopters in the corridor must be at or below 200 feet above sea level.\nRelated articleInvestigation into DC plane and helicopter collision looking at potential mistakes in ‘no margin for error’ situation\nInman noted that investigators “currently don’t have the readout from the Black Hawk” so they cannot provide information about what altitude the helicopter was flying at. But “obviously an impact occurred, and I would say when an impact occurs, that is typically where the altitude of both aircraft were at the moment,” he said.\nFlight tracking data from the moments before the fatal midair collisionappear to showthe helicopter flying 100 feet above its allowed altitude, and veering off the prescribed route along the Potomac River’s east side.\nBoth President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have raised the issue of altitude.\n“The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit,” Trump said in aTruth Social postFriday.\n“Someone was at the wrong altitude,” Hegseth told Fox News on Friday morning. “Was the Black Hawk too high? Was it on course? Right now, we don’t quite know.”\nThe helicopter’s black box voice recorder has also been recovered with no signs of exterior damage, according to Inman.\nThe NTSB has begun interviewing air traffic control personnel, which will continue for a few days, Inman said.\nThe slight increase in pitch could show the pilots trying to pull the plane up after suddenly noticing the helicopter, Mary Schiavo, former inspector general at the Department of Transportation, told CNN Saturday.\n“That tells us that they did not see the helicopter until just, you know, a second at impact,” Schiavo said. “But they had that one second to try to pull up.”\nThe discrepancy between the plane’s altitude and the helicopter altitude as reported by the air traffic controllers “is going to be the source of a lot of investigation,” Schiavo added.\nAt the time of the collision, the Black Hawk military helicopter was training to evacuate government officials in the case of a catastrophic event.\nJonathan Koziol, chief of staff for the Army’s aviation directorate, told reporters on Thursday the pilots were training for a scenario when “something really bad happens in this area, and we need to move our senior leaders.” That evacuation would be part of what Hegseth described as “a continuity of government mission.”\nTo carry out such an evacuation, Koziol added, pilots “do need to be able to understand the environment, the air traffic, the routes, to ensure the safe travel of our senior leaders throughout our government.”\nThe crash is thought to have killed 67 people, including three Army aviators in the Black Hawk: Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, who was identified Saturday; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Lloyd Eaves, 39. While the Army released the names of the other two soldiers on board the Black Hawk on Friday, Lobach’s name had been withheld at her family’s request.\nRelated articleExclusive: NTSB fought to retain employees after Trump’s federal worker resignation offer\nPilots who fly with the 12th Aviation Battalion, based out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, frequently fly along the Potomac River and past DC’s Reagan National Airport for various missions – often carrying general officers or Army leaders to and from the Pentagon, or other VIPs elsewhere in the Northeast.\nBrad Bowman, a former Black Hawk pilot and member of the 12th Aviation Battalion who served on September 11, 2001, told CNN that on the route past Reagan, the helicopters drop down to their lowest altitude of the entire flight, with the intention of getting low to “deconflict with aircraft at Reagan.”\n“(T)he low level helicopter routes have been in operation for decades – that area is one of the busiest aviation operation centers in the country, if not the world,” said Bowman, who is also a senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It is a concert or orchestra of activity that requires careful communication and cooperation between pilots and Reagan tower.”\n“Everyone has to be on their game and follow instruction exactly,” Bowman added.\nMeanwhile, reports have emerged that may show the collision is part of a larger problem. In the three years before the deadly collision, at least two otherpilots reported near misses with helicopterswhile landing at Reagan National Airport.\nThe inadequate staffing at the Reagan airport tower was also hardly an anomaly. Airports around the country havestruggled with controller staffinglevels for years, according to a CNN review of government data and interviews with aviation experts.\nThe midair collision between the Army Black Hawk helicopter and American EagleFlight 5342 near DC’s Reagan National Airport marks thedeadliest aviation disasterin the US since 2001.\nCrews are still working to recover the wreckage of the aircraft and bodies of the victims from the Potomac River. The victims include a number of young figure skaters returning from a development camp in Kansas, as well as three soldiers who were aboard the Black Hawk.\nThe NTSB is investigating the devastating crash and will take about 30 days to release a preliminary report. A final report, which will determine a probable cause, will take much longer, the boardsaid.\nRelated articleArmy identifies helicopter pilot Capt. Rebecca Lobach among 67 killed in DC plane collision. Here are some of their stories\nForty-two bodies have been recovered from the scene of the wreckage of the deadly midair collision over the Potomac River, authorities said Saturday.\n“Rescue crews have recovered 42 sets of remains and 38 have been positively identified by the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,” Unified Command said in a statement Saturday afternoon.\nThe Black Hawk helicopter, while briefly stabilized to assist with recovery efforts, remains in the water, authorities said.\n“Today, salvage crews from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage and Diving are assessing the area and preparing for the recovery of the aircraft,” a statement reads.\n“Divers from the salvage company are surveying the wreckage throughout the day. Additional barges and equipment are expected to arrive later this afternoon. No wreckage is expected to be removed on Saturday,” the statement continued.\nDC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly Sr. previously said he believed it was necessary to remove the fuselage of the plane from the water in order to recover all the bodies.\nAsked on Friday if authorities are confident they know where the remaining bodies are, Donnelly said, “we think we know where they are,” but “we won’t know until we’re done.”\nCNN’s Andy Rose, Aileen Graef, Michelle Watson and Emma Tucker contributed to this report."

            "text": "When an American Airlines flight fatally collided with a military helicopter near Reagan National Airport Wednesday night, the airport’s tower wasn’t fully staffed, with one traffic controller handling the jobs of two people.\nBut the situation was hardly an anomaly. Airports around the country have struggled with controller staffing levels for years, according to a CNN review of government data and interviews with aviation experts.\nThemost recent datafrom the Federal Aviation Administration shows that across all airport towers andterminal approach facilitiesnationwide, only about 70% of staffing targets were filled by fully certified controllers as of September 2023. When controllers in training are included, that rose to about 79%.\nSome traffic control towers at major airports around the country – including Philadelphia, Orlando, Austin, Albuquerque and Milwaukee – had less than 60% of their staffing targets filled with certified controllers. Reagan Airport had about 63%.\nAviation experts say it’s too early to tell whether a lack of sufficient staffing could have played a role in the disaster over the Potomac River that took 67 lives this week. But the tragedy could raise awareness of the staffing issues that go beyond a single airport.\nAir traffic controllers in the US have been warning about the impact of low staffing levels for years, submitting anonymous reports to NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System. At least 10 reports submitted by controllers included concerns about staffing, work schedules or fatigue in the last year alone, the NASAdatabaseshows.\n“We have been short staffed for too many years and it’s creating so many unsafe situations,” one controller in Southern California wrote last year, recounting how a small aircraft requesting assistance could not be helped due to workload issues. “The FAA has created an unsafe environment to work and for the flying public. The controllers’ mental health is deteriorating.”\n“We are already on forced 6-day work weeks working overtime every week,” another controller in Northern California wrote. “This Leads to Controller fatigue very quickly. We need more staffing.”\nSelf-reported safety incidents by aviation personnel recorded in NASA’s database detail hundreds of incidents since 2015 in which pilots said they were forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with another aircraft or helicopter when trying to land or depart from the country’s busiest airports.\nThere were more reports of such incidents at Reagan National – which processes over 25 million passengers per year – than at any of the top 10 busiest airports in the country. Pilots and controllers coming through DCA reported at least 50 incidents of aircrafts being forced to move out of the way of other planes or helicopters in the past ten years.\nLas Vegas, where nearly 60 million travelers pass through the airport every year, counted more than 40 reports of evasive action in the ASRS database over the last decade.\nIn Miami, which sees double DCA’s passengers per year but only filled 60% of its target control tower staffing with fully certified controllers in September 2023, pilots and controllers reported about three dozen incidents in which they said aircrafts needed to take action to avoid collision in the past 10 years.\nReagan National stood out as well in the number of reports describing near collisions between aircrafts and helicopters. Pilots flying through DCA reported at least 23 such incidents since the data was collected in 1988. Most of the busiest airports in the US had less than 5 reports detailing near-misses between planes and helicopters in that timeframe.\nIn 2023, after a series of close calls at airports around the country, the FAA commissioned a safety review of the national airspace system. An independent team produceda reportthat found inadequate air-traffic control staffing, combined with outdated equipment and technology, was “rendering the current level of safety unsustainable.” The report added that overtime among air traffic controllers had reached historically high levels and contributed to absences and fatigue.\nWith “fewer eyes on the airspace… the opportunity for mistakes in instruction is multiplied,” the report stated, noting there were about 1,000 fewer fully certified air traffic controllers in August 2023 than in August 2012, despite more complexity in the national air space.\nThe National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a union, has also beenwarningabout staffing shortages for more than a decade.\nThe union’s president, Nick Daniels,statedin a letter Thursday that it’s “premature to speculate on the root cause” of the DC collision. In response to a question about howone air traffic controllerwas working two different tower positions at the time, Daniels said it’s not uncommon for air traffic controllers to “combine” or “de-combine sectors to ensure that we can maximize efficiency and safety.”\nThe shortages come in part because of attrition during the Covid-19 pandemic and the stringent training that is required for new hires, experts say.\nAn inspector generalreportfrom 2023 stated that the pandemic led to training pauses over a period of about two years, which increased certification times for new controllers as older controllers continued to retire, though the report also noted that the FAA had made “limited efforts” to ensure adequate staffing.\n“It takes a long time to train an air traffic controller,” Mary Schiavo, a former Department of Transportation inspector general, told CNN. “It’s very expensive. And about a third of them wash out because it’s very rigorous.”\nThe FAA has recently touted more success in hiring controllers. In the government’s most recent fiscal year, which covered October 2023 through September 2024, the agency exceeded its hiring goal by bringing on more than 1,800 controllers, the agency said in astatement, calling it “important progress… to reverse the decades-long air traffic controller staffing level decline.”\nSeparately, in a statement shared with CNN, the FAA noted that aircraft in the US are kept safely separated by standard routes in and out of airports, on-board collision-avoidance systems on airliners as well as runway safety technology at the busiest airports.\nThe DC disaster has also raised alarms about the Trump administration’s offer of employment buyouts to air traffic controllers, as part of alarger programletting federal employees accept a deferred retirement. If a substantial number of controllers accept the deferred retirement, that could undo progress that federal officials have made in filling vacant positions.\n“That would have a huge impact on what we already have as a shortage,” Rep. Jennifer McClellan, a Virginia Democrat, said of the buyout proposal. “You already have workers that are stressed and trying to meet the needs to keep the American people safe.”\nCNN’s Scott Glover, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Winter Hawk, Rob Kuznia and Audrey Ash contributed to this report."

            "category": "world",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "In the three years before the deadly collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight near Reagan National Airport, at least two other pilots reported near-misses with helicopters while landing at the airport, a CNN review of federal incident reports found.\nOn two occasions, passenger planes had to take evasive action to avoid colliding with a helicopter when trying to land at the airport, according to reports filed by pilots. In a third incident, two military helicopters got too close together, an air traffic controller reported.\nAnd just a day before the fatal collision, another flight approaching Reagan was forced to abort its first landing and go around after a helicopter flew near its flight path, according to air traffic control audio.\nThose previous scares are sure to gain more attention after the disaster over the Potomac River on Wednesday night, which is presumed to have killed 64 people aboard the plane and three Army servicemembers on a helicopter training flight.\nAs a search and recovery operation continues in and around the Potomac, authorities are trying to figure out exactly what went wrong in the air above the nation’s capital.\nAt the time of the collision, one air traffic controller at Reagan was overseeing both helicopters and planes, an air traffic control source told CNN. Though the jobs are typically handled by two people, the source said having one person handle both isn’t uncommon.\nStill, a preliminary Federal Aviation Administration report found that staffing at the airport’s traffic control tower was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,” the New York TimesreportedThursday. That corresponds with an issue highlighted in one of the previous near-miss reports from 2022, in which a controller said that there wasn’t enough staffing at the airport tower.\nAviation experts say that the Washington region is a uniquely complex airspace to navigate. Flight restrictions enacted after 9/11 block air traffic from going near government buildings, military and government helicopters regularly traverse the area, and flights are constantly taking off and landing at Reagan, which has the busiest runway in the country.\nIn recent years, proposals to add more flights to the airport have also sparked heated political fights, with some lawmakers previously arguing that the airport was excessively congested and warning about safety impacts.\nNow, the deadliest American aviation disaster since 2001 could lead to changes in how planes maneuver at DCA, or potentially broader reforms.\n“It’s unbelievable how much we fly without incident,” said former FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt. “So when we do have one, it lights up everything.”\nThe previous near-misses between planes and helicopters at DCA airport were detailed in NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting Systemdatabase, which records incidents reported by aviation personnel. The reports are filed anonymously and don’t identify specific airlines or flights.\nThere have been 23 near midair collisions between passenger planes and helicopters at Ronald Reagan National Airport since 1988, when NASA started collecting the safety reports. Ten of those incidents happened in the past 12 years.\nIn April 2024, a commercial passenger plane pilot wrote that while descending to DCA, the crew received a traffic alert and collision avoidance system alert showing a helicopter “about 300ft below us.” The crew “took evasive action,” according to the report, and then was able to land normally after passing above the helicopter.\n“We never received a warning of the traffic from (air traffic control) so we were unaware it was there,” the pilot wrote, suggesting that there should be “better separation for DCA traffic on the river visual to the helicopter traffic that is flying up and down the river.”\nIn another incident in October 2022, a pilot of a passenger plane reported that while descending at DCA, the plane’s collision avoidance system alerted the crew to nearby “traffic” and directed them to “CLIMB NOW.” The aircraft aborted the landing, circled around, and successfully landed on the second try.\n“Upon review of the approach path and other information, we estimate we came within 300 ft. or less of what turned out to be a helicopter lifting off of the hospital,” the pilot wrote.\nIn both of the incidents, the pilots reported that they were landing at runway 19, which was not the runway that the American Airlines flight was set to land on Wednesday night before the collision. Both planes were listed as operating under “part 121,” a regulatory certificate thatgenerally coverslarge U.S.-based airlines and regional air carriers.\nAnd in both cases, the pilots reported that they never saw the helicopter they potentially came within a few hundred feet of hitting.\nA third incident in the database, reported by an air traffic controller working at DCA, described an “airborne conflict” between two military helicopters near the airport in September 2022, although the exact details are unclear.\nThe two helicopters got too close to each other at a time when “there isn’t enough staffing to fill all positions in the tower cab,” the controller wrote – referring to the cabin of the air control tower.\nMore recently, Republic Airways Flight 4514 aborted its landing Tuesday night while approaching runway 19 after air traffic control warned it about a nearby helicopter, according to audio fromLiveATC.net. The twin engine Embraer ERJ 175 began a climbing right turn away from the airport, and later landed successfully, data fromFlightAware, a flight-tracking website, shows.\nThe plane, which was flying from Connecticut, reached an altitude of about 1,600 feet during its first descent, while the helicopter was at about 300 feet, according to the audio and flight-tracking data – so the aircraft didn’t get as close as the earlier near-misses. The Washington Postfirst reportedthe Tuesday incident.\nBabbitt, the former FAA administrator, said he was not familiar with the specific incidents, but noted helicopters often respond to emergency situations that may in some instances make getting to the scene of an accident more of a priority than air-space regulations. Because helicopters fly at low altitude in the region, they rarely create issues for planes, he said.\nIt’s unclear whether any policies were changed or air traffic controllers took any actions in response to the previous near-misses.\nBecause the NASA database only covers incidents reported by aviation personnel, it doesn’t necessarily cover all near-misses, and includes raw reports that have not necessarily been confirmed by an investigation. In addition to the near-misses involving helicopters, the airport has seenseveralpreviously reportednear-missesbetween planes while landing or taking off in recent years.\nThe collision Wednesday night happened in an area that is “one of the busiest aviation operation centers in the country if not the world,” said Brad Bowman, a former Black Hawk pilot and member of the 12th Aviation Battalion, the Army unit involved in the crash.\n“It is a concert or orchestra of activity that requires careful communication and cooperation between pilots and Reagan tower,” Bowman told CNN. “Everyone has to be on their game and follow instruction exactly.”\nAudio from moments before the disaster captured byLiveATC.netshows that an air traffic controller asked the helicopter pilot if he could see the plane and then directed him to “pass behind” it. The helicopter pilot responded that he had “aircraft in sight.”\nThe helicopter was on a routine training mission at the time of the collision, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters Thursday. “Tragically, last night, a mistake was made,” Hegseth said, adding that the Department of Defense was investigating.\nIt isn’t unusual for helicopters to be flying above the Potomac near the airport, aviation observers said. Between 2017 and 2019, there was an average of about 80 helicopter flights  each day within 30 miles of DCA, according to areportfrom the Government Accountability Office.\n“It is completely normal for helicopters to be flying in that area,” said Ian Petchenik, a spokesperson for Flightradar24   , a flight-tracking company. “There are helicopter routes in that airspace defined by position and altitude. They operate there on a regular basis.”\nPilots with the 12th Aviation Battalion, which is based out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, frequently fly along the Potomac River and past the airport for various missions, such as shuttling military officers to and from the Pentagon or taking members of Congress to Camp David, Bowman said.\nThe Army helicopter appeared to be following a defined helicopter flight path above the Potomac, according to anFAA map, although it shifted slightly to thewestjust before the collision. The map states that “all routes may be altered at pilot’s request or as directed by” air traffic control.\nHelicopters following the route are supposed to stay at or below 200 feet in the area where the collision occurred, according to the FAA map. The Army copter was flying at that altitude at its last readingreportedto flight tracking services.\nA former air traffic controller who worked at DCA years ago, andasked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the incident, told CNN that controllers sometimes may have focused less on helicopters because of the altitude restrictions that typically keep them away from flights.\n“Generally the way it worked was we’d get a contact from these helicopters and they’d say they’re going to be passing through the airspace,” the former controller said about his time in the control tower. “They’d be told to stay below 200 feet and there really wasn’t much attention paid to them.”\nCongress last year approved legislation adding five new round-trip flights to Reagan, over the objections of lawmakers from the region and some advocacy groups who argued that the airport was already too congested and raised safety concerns about the additional traffic.\nThe measure, which waspassedas part of the FAA’s reauthorization in May 2024, came after previous legislative efforts to expand flights at the airport had failed. The fight had divided airlines, with Deltaadvocatingfor the proposal, and American, United and Alaskaopposingit.\nSeveral lawmakers pointed to near-misses between planes at DCA in March 2023 and April 2024 in opposing the expansion at an airport that has been seeingrecord numbersof passengers.\nThe close calls show “why we can’t keep cramming more flights to this airport,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kainepostedon social media last year. “I’ve been warning about this for years—the system is overwhelmed and it’s a threat to public safety.” Some expansion opponents in the Virginia area also objected because of concerns over increased noise and air traffic from additional flights.\nBeyond Washington, experts have been ringing alarms for years about increasing stress on the aviation system and a growing tally of close calls at airports around the country. An FAA report last yearfoundthat air traffic control stations nationwide were about 3,000 controllers short of being fully staffed.\n“This problem with congested airspace and near-misses has been brewing for several years,” former Transportation Department Inspector General Mary Schiavo told CNN. “It’s near-misses in the air, tremendous numbers of near-misses at the airport and runway incursions.”\nNow, the DC collision is a shocking tragedy for an American industry that had prided itself on going adecade and a halfwithout a fatal commercial airline crash.\n“From a human perspective, this is something that should never happen and it’s tragic,” said the former DCA air traffic controller. But “from a realistic perspective, with humans controlling the aircraft, controlling the traffic, and dealing in these complex environments,” the controller said, a disaster like the collision over the Potomac is chillingly possible.\nCNN’s Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Natasha Bertrand, Aaron Cooper, Scott Glover, Rob Kuznia, Daniel A. Medina and Pete Muntean contributed reporting.\nEditor’s Note: This story was updated to include additional information about near midair collisions."

Zelensky noted that there were 60,000 Russian troops in Kursk and 12,000 North Koreans.\nZelensky also said that one-third of those North Korean troops had been killed.\nRelated articleSuicidal tendencies and ’80s battlefield tactics: How North Korean soldiers are operating in Russia’s war on Ukraine\nCNN has previously reported on thebrutal and near-suicidal tacticsof North Korean soldiers, who in some cases have detonated grenades rather than becaptured by Ukrainian forcesand have written pledges of allegiance on the battlefield to North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.\nA commander with the 6th Special Operations Forces regiment, who did not want to give his name for security reasons, told CNN that while the North Korean soldiers are “all young, trained, hardy fighters,” they would have not previously faced drones in combat. “They are prepared for the realities of war in 1980 at best,” he said.\nAnother battalion serviceman told CNN the North Koreans had shown good marksmanship when shooting down drones from about a 100-meter distance, suggesting a high level of training in North Korea.\nHowever, Russia appears to be using the troops as foot soldiers, using them to carry out mass ground assaults despite major losses in Kursk.\nUkraine has recently made advancements in Kursk, according to a battlefield update from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a DC-based think-tank, on January 26. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said earlier this week that Russian forces recaptured the Kursk region village of Nikolayevo-Daryino, which lies on the Russia-Ukraine border.\nNeither Moscow nor Pyongyang have officially acknowledged the presence of North Korean troops in Russia.\nLast year, months before the deployment of North Koreans to Russia, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin signed alandmark defense pactand pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.\nThe pact is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and has been viewed as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge.\nCNN’s Nick Paton Walsh, Rebecca Wright, Daria Tarasova-Markina, Brice Laine and Helen Regan contributed to this report."

            "tags": "",
            "text": "An arrest warrant has been issued for a New York doctor indicted on Friday by a Louisiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing abortion pills online to a pregnant minor in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.\nGrand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge unanimously issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and the minor’s mother. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.\nIn addition to Carpenter, an arrest warrant was issued for the mother, who has not been publicly identified to protect the identity of the minor. District Attorney Tony Clayton told The Associated Press that the mother turned herself in to police on Friday.\nThe case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.\n“We expect Dr. Carpenter to come to Louisiana and answer to these charges, and if 12 people (a jury) think she’s innocent then, let it go,” Clayton said.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a video posted on social media, “I will never, under any circumstances, turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition requests,” signaling a potential legal battle between the states.\nLast year, the Port Allen, Louisiana, woman requested abortion medication online from Carpenter for her daughter, whose age has not been specified. Clayton said the request was made through a questionnaire only and no consultation with the girl.\nA “cocktail of pills” was mailed to the woman who directed her daughter to take the pill, Clayton said.\nAfter taking the drug, the girl experienced a medical emergency while alone, called 911 and was transported to the hospital where she was treated. While responding to the emergency, a police officer learned about the pills and under further investigation found that a doctor in New York state had supplied the drugs and turned their findings over to Clayton’s office.\nIt is unclear how far along the girl was in her pregnancy.\n“The (adult) mother has since been arrested, but the other person we believe is just as culpable here is the person who sat in an office, wrapped a box of pills, put a stamp on the box and mailed it to the state of Louisiana for a child to take,” Clayton said.\nCarpenter wassued in December by the Texas attorney generalunder similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.\nCarpenter did not immediately return a message from the AP.\nThe indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law reclassifying both mifepristone and misoprostol as “controlled dangerous substances.” The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel must take extra steps to access them.\nUnder the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses either medication without a valid prescription, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescriptionto take on their own.\n“I have said it before and I will say it again: We will hold individuals accountable for breaking the law,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, said in a statement on Friday.\nAbortion opponents and reproductive rights groups alike flooded social media scrutinizing the indictment.\n“We cannot continue to allow forced birth extremists to interfere with our ability to access necessary healthcare,” Chasity Wilson, executive director of the Louisiana Abortion Fund, said in a statement. “Extremists hope this case will cause a chilling effect, further tying the hands of doctors who took an oath to care for their patients.”\nSince the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.\n“Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we’ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women’s rights,” the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. “It’s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.”\nFriday’s indictment could be the first direct test of New York’s shield laws, which areintended to protect prescriberswho use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. New York Attorney General Letitia James said “we will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers’ ability to deliver critical care.”\n“This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American,” James added.\nPills have become themost common meansof abortion in the US, accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They’re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, a judge let three states continue tochallenge federal government approvalsfor how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

            "category": "world",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "President Donald Trump has called for an expansive, next-generationmissile defense shieldfor the mainland United States, something modeled on Israel’s formidable defenses, typified by its signature Iron Dome system.\nA defensive dome for the US – a country hundreds of times the size of Israel – would require massive scale, as well as space-based interceptors, and almost certainly be decades away.\nYeton the piece of US soil perhaps most vulnerable to missile attacks – the Pacific island of Guam – work is well underway on the kind of multi-layered missile defense that could point the way.\nHowever, experts say even that faces steep challenges.\n“There are no fast or panacea solutions, and we are making the decisions late in the game even though visionary military and political leaders saw this coming in the 1990s,” said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.\nThe US territory of Guam, a 210-square-mile island in the Pacific Ocean, is home to just under 175,000 people. It also hostsAndersen Air Force Base– a key deployment base for US Air Force bombers such as the B-1 and B-52 and sometimes the stealthy B-2 – and is homeport to US nuclear attack submarines that could be vital in any defense of Taiwan.\nThe island is less than 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) from China (PRC) and 2,100 miles from North Korea. Mockups of it have shown up inChina’s military propaganda videos, and North Korea has made threats against it.\nBut the US military has not stood still, advancing its ability to defend against regional threats.\nJust last December, the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) conducted the first successful intercept of a ballistic missile target from the island using the Aegis Guam System, which fired a land-based interceptor of the type that US Navy ships have used to destroy ballistic missile targets in testing.\n“Current forces are capable of defending Guam against today’s North Korean ballistic missile threats. However, the regional threat to Guam, including those from PRC, continues to rapidly evolve,” the MDA’s director for operations, Michelle Atkinson, said in 2023.\nIn the December test, a US Air Force C-17 plane released a medium-range ballistic missile target off Guam’s coast. After the target was tracked by powerful radar, an interceptor was fired from a Vertical Launch System on the island, taking it out outside Earth’s atmosphere, according to releases by MDA and Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the Aegis system on Guam.\nIt was a “a critical milestone in the defense of Guam and the region,” said US Navy Rear Adm. Greg Huffman, commander, Joint Task Force-Micronesia.\nBut the intercept test went beyond the land-based Aegis system, with other military elements testing systems that would form key parts of the multi-layered concept Trump would like to see.\nCNN asked followers on social media if they have questions about the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. From your responses, we picked some of the most-asked topics and put the key question to CNN’s Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson. Here, we ask about the capabilities of Israel’s Iron Dome.\nRelated videoCNN answers questions on Israel’s Iron Dome\nThat’s something akin to what Israel fields, a four-tiered system often lumped under the “Iron Dome” moniker, after its best-known and lowest layer. While the Iron Dome combats incoming rockets and artillery weapons, David’s Sling protects against short- and medium-range threats, and the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems stop ballistic missiles.\nIn a nod to a similarly layered defensive structure, US Indo-Pacific Command said it used December’s intercept to test tracking capabilities of the US Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system based on Guam.\nTHAAD is designed to stop incoming missiles in their terminal, or descent, phase of flight, while Aegis makes its intercept in the mid-course phase, outside Earth’s atmosphere, before the missiles dive on their target.\nThe US military also employs Patriot missile batteries, designed to make much lower-altitude intercepts, as the final phase of Guam’s defense. Both the THAAD and Patriot systems have been successfully used in combat.\nAll three – Aegis, THAAD and Patriot – will eventually form what is called the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (EIAMD) on Guam, which the MDA says will provide “360-degree coverage, and layered defense against regional ballistic, maneuvering ballistic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missile threats.”\nThat system would also rely on input from US satellites and space-based sensors, according to the MDA, inching it closer to Trump’s missile defense vision.\nBut the timeline for full Guam missile defense – expected to take at least a decade to put together – is indicative of the challenges in constructing any system to fight ballistic and hypersonic glide missiles. That’s not helped by constant technological advances in missile technology, which often evolves more quickly than ways to defend against it.\nAnd Trump’s concept of anext-generation missile defense for the continental US goes well beyond what is still years away on Guam, an island about 10 times the size of Manhattan.\nRelated articleTrump signs executive orders to reshape the military, including banning transgender troops\nIn his executive order, Trump said he would “direct(the US) military to begin construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be made all in the USA,” as the US faces a “catastrophic threat” from ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles.\nHis ambitious executive order called for an acceleration in “the development and deployment of Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layers, proliferated space-based interceptors, a Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, capabilities to defeat salvoes prior to launch, non-kinetic missile defense capabilities, and underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities.”\nTrump’s order does not give any estimate of the costs of such a system, but several hundreds of billions of dollars would probably be a conservative estimate.\n“The costs of reliably defending an area the size of the United States against a wide variety of threats at multiple different intercept points would be astronomical,” said Matt Korda, associate director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\nAnd as far as money goes, the advantage goes to the attacker.\n“Offense is cheaper than defense every single time,” Korda said.\nEven if US technology can develop and deploy all that Trump is asking for, impregnable missile defense could still prove impossible.\nThough it is touted by many as the world’s best missile defense, attacks by Iran last year showed that the Iron Done is far from unbeatable, with projectiles fired by Tehran and Houthi rebels landing in Israel.\nRelated articleUS concerned Israel’s Iron Dome could be overwhelmed in war with Hezbollah, officials say\nIran achieved that by firing large numbers of weapons at Israel. While manyof thearound 180 missiles launchedwere intercepted, some got through. Missile defense experts have long pointed out that’s one way to beat any missile defense system.\nSchuster, a former US Navy captain who worked on the Aegis missile defense system in its early days, said missile defenses can be “saturated,” pointing out that the incoming ballistic missile knows where it’s going, but the interceptors have to be directed to their target.\n“You can only guide so many (interceptors) at any one time while the ballistic missile has an internal guidance system,” Schuster said.\nThe problem for defenders becomes more difficult once warheads with “maneuverable reentry vehicles” – which can change directions after they reenter the atmosphere and approach targets from different directions – are added. Both China and Russia have such capabilities.\n“A target coming directly at you is the easiest to intercept. The greater the lateral displacement from that, the more challenging the intercept equation,” Schuster said.\nAdversaries can compound that problem by firing decoy missiles, which distract from more important targets – which if they involve nuclear warheads, could do catastrophic damage.\nOf course, all that comes into play once a system is actuallydeployed.\nAnd,according to Schuster, the biggest stumbling block for Trump’s shield plan could be a US production and procurement system that has been neglected –despite the early successes demonstrated on Guam.\n“Our production rates are criminally low in my opinion,” he said. “We have been asleep at the switch … for over a decade.”\nAnd it’s not just a manufacturing infrastructure problem, it’s also the limited knowledge and skills to produce them, Schuster said.\n“We are going to have to invest in both plant, which we do well, and people, which we don’t do well.”"

            "text": "All 67 people on board the American Airlines regional jet and US Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided midair Wednesday night are presumed dead – a grim tragedy that has left a heartbreaking trail of mourning families in its wake.\nThe somber day will be remembered as thedeadliest aviation disasterin the US since 2001.\nAs details of the disturbing catastrophe emerge and additional bodies are identified, the full weight and impact of the lives lost grows heavier. Here are some of the victims of the tragedy identified so far.\nThe female Black Hawk pilot who was co-piloting the aircraft when it collided with the passenger plane this week was a “driven and hardworking” officer who “was made for” Army aviation, those who knew her recalled to CNN on Saturday.\nThe Army officially identified the pilot as Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, one of the three-person crew inside the UH-60 Black Hawk. While the Army released the names of the other two soldiers on board the Black Hawk on Friday, Lobach’s name had been withheld at her family’s request.\nCNN previously reported Lobach was co-piloting the Black Hawk at the time ofthe collisionon Wednesday evening.\nA statement released Saturday by the Lobach family called her a “bright star” who was “kind, generous, brilliant, funny, ambitious and strong.”\n“Rebecca was a warrior and would not hesitate to defend her country in battle. But she was as graceful as she was fierce: in addition to her duties as an Army aviator, Rebecca was honored to serve as a White House Military Social Aide, volunteering to support the President and First Lady in hosting countless White House events, including ceremonies awarding the Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom,” the family’s statement said.\nCapt. Bilal Kordab, an Army officer who recruited Lobach into the North Carolina National Guard while she was a student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, told CNN Lobach was “a driven and hardworking individual that absolutely worked her tail off” to accomplish what she did.\n“She was not handed anything. She was more than qualified for anything that she was able to accomplish,” Kordab said. “She excelled in everything,” including flight school. Lobach commissioned into the Army as an active-duty aviation officer from the ROTC program at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2019.\nChief Warrant Officer 2 Sabrina Bell, who now serves in Alaska but who previously served with Lobach in the same company at the 12th Aviation Battalion, told CNN Lobach was “head-over-heels motivated” from the moment she arrived at the unit.\nAs an officer, Lobach had a unique ability to connect with not only her soldiers but the leaders above her, Bell said. “I can easily say she is one of the best leaders that I have ever had,” Bell said.\nThe US Army earlier released the names of two of the two other soldiers onboard the Black Hawk military helicopter.\nRyan O’Hara, 28, from Lilburn, Georgia, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, from Great Mills, Maryland, died in the crash. Eaves was the instructor pilot on board and had about 1,000 flight hours, according to Army official Jonathan Koziol.\nO’Hara is being remembered by a fellow service member as “one of the finest, most disciplined, committed trainers” he has ever worked with.\nJosh Muehlendorf, Chief Warrant Officer 5 with the US Army, worked with O’Hara when he was a senior instructor pilot of the battalion O’Hara was in.\n“I’ve flown dozens of flights with Ryan O’Hara, trying to tap into his expertise on Hoist operation,” Muehlendorf said.\nO’Hara graduated from Parkview High School in Gwinnett County, Georgia, in 2014, CNN affiliate WSB reported.\n“Ryan is fondly remembered as a guy who would fix things around the ROTC gym as well as a vital member of the Rifle Team.

The debrief promptly ended,” Muehlendorf said.\n“A huge loss to Army Aviation and the world around him. May he rest in peace, and may our Father be a comfort to his dear family,” he said.\nJust weeks ago, young figure skater Brielle Beyer celebrated her birthday with a sleepover party her mom, Justyna Magdalena Beyer, organized with a movie night, tents and a rainbow balloon arch.\nThe decorations are still up – but both mother and daughter, of Northern Virginia, were killed in Wednesday’s tragedy, leaving their family struggling to grapple with the enormity of their loss.\n“I’m just so in shock right now,” Andy Beyer, Brielle’s dad and Justyna’s husband, told CNN. “There’s like a place in my mind that I can’t get near with all of the pain and grief. It’s like the door in my house to my daughter’s room – I just can’t go anywhere near it.”\nBeyer fondly recalled a memory of Brielle choreographing her own skating routine and performing it on the rink when she was just 10. It was his favorite performance she ever did.\n“She was just the sweetest girl,” he said, adding his wife was always “pouring her heart out for her children.”\n“Justyna did not do anything small for the kids, everything she did was big and it had to be special and beautiful and memorable. That was how she expressed herself as a mom.”\nAn ice skating rink manager said his tight-knit Northern Virginia figure skating community lost 14 members in the accident.\n“Many children spend long hours here practicing daily, which means their parents spend long hours here, which means we get to know the families on a very intimate level,” Ashburn Ice House General Manager Rob Lorenzen said at a Friday news conference.\n“This is such a terrible tragedy,” he said.\nJulia Kay and her son, 11-year-old Sean Kay, leave behind a broken-hearted husband and father – and three other children – after they were killed in the horrific collision.\nVitali Kay and his wife, Julia, had been together for more than 20 years after meeting in college, he toldCNN affiliate KYW. He described Julia as “full of energy.”\n“The plane was supposed to land at 9, and I called my wife and she didn’t pick up,” he told KYW. “I thought maybe it was on airplane mode and she forgot to switch it off.”\nSean was an ice skater at the University of Delaware, his father toldKYW. His coach and at least three other youth figure skaters were also killed.\nSean loved playing his guitar, even bringing it to a Metallica concert in Philadelphia last May,The Washington Postreported.\nKay told The Washington Post Sean, who was a curious child, developed an interest in ice skating after his older sister began skating and he noticed there were cute girls involved in the sport.\nMelissa Jane Nicandri, 28, from New York, was “everything that anyone could hope for with a daughter,” her family told CNN in a statement confirming their unfathomable loss.\n“We are devastated by the sudden loss of Melissa,” the Nicandri family said. “Melissa had an adventurous spirit and will be missed forever.”\nNicandri was “beautiful, smart, funny, kind and generous,” her family said, expressing their desire for space during their time of mourning.\n“At just 28 years old, her life was tragically cut short,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statementon X.\nFlight attendant Danasia Elder, a mother of two, was one of the people killed in Wednesday’s midair collision, the Association of Flight Attendants-Communications Workers of Americaannounced in a Facebook post.\nShe was based out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and had been flying since last year, the union said. Her brother-in-law, Brandon Payne, toldCNN affiliate WSOCshe was “a great wife, a great parent, a great friend.”\n“She was very bright, very smart. She was an entrepreneur.

I love to travel to the mountains and spend time fishing,” she wrote in her school bio.\nSam Lilley, a young fiancé awaiting his fall wedding, was piloting the American Airlines flight minutes away from a safe landing when a collision with an Army helicopter plunged both aircraft and everyone on board into Virginia’s Potomac River.\n“I was so proud when Sam became a pilot,” Lilley’s father, Timothy Lilley, said in aFacebookpost Thursday. “Now it hurts so bad I can’t even cry myself to sleep. I know I’ll see him again but my heart is breaking.”\nLilley, 28, was the first officer on the flight, his father said in the post, and was “doing great in his career and his personal life.”\n“It is so devastating to lose someone that is loved so much,” Timothy Lilley said. “This is undoubtedly the worst day of my life,” he toldFOX 5 Atlanta.\nThe grieving father, who served as a helicopter pilot in the Army for 20 years, said he believes the commercial jet involved in the incident was following proper procedures.\n“From what I can see, those guys turned right into the jet. I think the PSA jet was doing everything right,” Lilley told Fox 5 Atlanta. “The Army pilot made a grave error. It hurts me because those are my brothers, and now my son is dead.”\nJonathan Campos, the captain of the American Airlines flight, was also killed, according to a fellow pilot who knew Campos personally. The colleague said Campos became a captain for the airline in 2022.\n“He was an amazing person,” Campos’ family member, Edward Campos, told CNN. “He loved flying.

He loved life. He loved traveling. He loved his job. He loved his family. And he will be sorely missed,” Bloom said.\nEpstein, who had been a flight attendant for several years, leaves behind two children and two stepchildren, according to Bloom.\n“He made friends everywhere he went. He used to talk about the people he met on the plane as if they were all new friends,” Bloom said.\nGarrick McFadden, a friend and former colleague of Epstein, told CNN’s Laura Coates that Epstein was “a ball of vibrant, colorful energy.”\nMcFadden also noted how tight-knit the flight attendant community is, and how the loss of Epstein hits home.\n“We love our job. We get up every day, a lot of us do it because we just love people, regardless of pay,” McFadden said. “But Ian definitely was one of the greatest examples of (that).”\n“I miss him,” McFadden said.\nAsra Hussain Raza, 26, was one of several victims killed, her father-in-law, Dr. Hashim Raza, told CNN.\nA daughter of Indian immigrants, Hussain Raza graduated with honors in 2020 from Indiana University and married her college sweetheart in August 2023, Raza said.\nRaza was a Washington, DC-based consultant who traveled to Wichita twice a month to work on a turnaround project for a hospital there, her father-in-law said.

She remembered that they always had a “smile on their face.”\n“To walk in here and not see that, I think would be very strange for everybody that comes here, especially those that are here day in and day out,” she said. “It’s going to be hard.”\nYouth skaters Sean Kay and Angela Yang, and their coach Alexandr “Sasha” Kirsanov, all from Delaware, died in the crash, state Sen. Chris Coons said.\n“Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang went to Wichita to pursue their passion for figure skating,”Coons posted on X Thursday. “It is a tragedy that none of them returned home to our state.”\nKirsanov’s wife, Natalia Gudin, toldDelaware Online/The News Journalthat Kay and Young were an amazing team and had a big future ahead.\n“For me, it’s a triple loss,” Gudin said.

Donnelly. By late that afternoon, more than 40 bodies had been recovered, multiple sources with knowledge of the recovery told CNN. There were 64 people on board the plane – which was flying from Wichita, Kansas – and three soldiers in the Army helicopter, according to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser.\n“Sadly, there are no survivors,” President Donald Trump said in a news conference at the White House late Thursday morning.\n“This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation’s capital and in our nation’s history, and a tragedy of terrible proportions,” Trump said. “As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly.”\nAmong the dead are American Airlines pilotsJonathan CamposandSamuel Lilley, twoflight attendantsand several members of theUS figure skating community, according to friends, family and sports groups.\nPresident Donald Trump said he plans to meet with victims’ families, though he did not say when.\nHere’s what we know about the crash – now the subject of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation and the deadliest aviation disaster in the US in more than two decades.\nAmerican Airlines Flight 5342 was due to land at the Reagan National airport Wednesday night when the aircraft – a Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet – collided midair with the Army helicopter as the plane approached Runway 33, according to the Federal Aviation Administration and defense officials.\nFlight records showed the passenger plane was expected to land around 9 p.m. But at 8:53 p.m., DC police began receiving calls about “an aircraft crash above the Potomac River,” the agency said.\nThe crash appears to have been a “very quick, rapid impact” and so far there is no indication that emergency evacuation slides were deployed, National Transportation Safety Board member J. Todd Inman said. He cautioned that the information is still preliminary.\nA video of the crash filmed by EarthCam shows what appears to be the helicopter and plane colliding in the sky, resulting in a fiery explosion.\nThe collision occurred while the helicopter with the 12th Aviation Battalion was conducting a routine training for pilots who take part in “continuity of government” missions, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at the White House Thursday.\n“Tragically, last night, a mistake was made,” Hegseth said. “There was some, some sort of an elevation issue that we have immediately begun investigating at the DOD and Army level.”\nThe battalion is currently on an operational pause, pending a review, Hegseth said. An investigation will seek to determine whether the helicopter was in the proper corridor and at the right altitude at the time of the collision, he said.\nNewly sworn-in Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy had earlier indicated both the helicopter and the American Airlines flight were operating in “standard” flight patterns.\n“At this time, we don’t know why the military aircraft came into the path of the PSA aircraft,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said Thursday morning.\nAt the time of the collision, one air traffic controller was working two different tower positions and was handling both local and helicopter traffic, an air traffic control source told CNN. The source described the set-up as not uncommon. However, theNew York Times reportedthat an internal preliminary Federal Aviation Administration report says staffing was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.”\nAri Schulman said he was driving home when he witnessed the collision.\n“Initially I saw the plane and it looked fine. Normal. It was right about to head over land, maybe 120 feet above the water,” Schulman told CNN.Seconds later, the plane “was banked all the way to the right… past 90 degrees.”\n“I could see the underside of it. It was lit up a very bright yellow, and there was a stream of sparks underneath it” and then everything went dark, he said.\nAir traffic controller audio obtained by CNN from LiveATC.net captured air traffic control operators directing the helicopter to pass behind the passenger plane.\nAn air traffic controller said, “PAT 2-5 do you have the CRJ in sight?”\nThe controller then said, “PAT 2-5 pass behind the CRJ.”\nAdditional air traffic control audio shortly before the collision captures the helicopter pilot saying, “PAT 2-5 has aircraft in sight, request visual separation.”\nLess than 13 seconds later, the audio then captured audible gasps, including a loud “oooh” in the background apparently from the tower, at the moment of the crash.\nAll takeoffs and landings were halted at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport until 11 a.m. Thursday, when the airport resumed flight operations. However, airport authorities are directing passengers to check with airlines about canceled or delayed flights.\nIt is believed there are no survivors from the collision, and rescuers must now conduct a recovery operation in the frigid waters of the Potomac River before the federal investigation can get underway, said National Transportation and Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy.\n“It’s a highly complex operation. The conditions out there are extremely rough,” said Donnelly, the DC Fire and EMS chief. He added that officials are confident they will recover all bodies of those killed.\nThe mangledwreckage is making the recovery effort particularly difficult for the dive teams, who have had trouble accessing parts of the plane’s fuselage. It has been an extensive recovery effort described as including essentially every dive team in the area.\nThe section of the river divers are working in is about 8 feet deep, dark and murky with floating pieces of ice, Donnelly said, adding search efforts will likely take days.\nThe wreckage of the American Airlines jet was broken apart, said Duffy, the transportation secretary, with the fuselage found in three different sections in waist-deep water.\nSo far only one flight data recorder, also known as a black box, has been retrieved from the CRJ-700 aircraft, Washington Senator Maria Cantwell’s office told CNN. It was not immediately clear which of the plane’s two black boxes has been retrieved.\nRecovering those items, which record both cockpit conversations and a slew of data points from the avionics, will be key as the NTSB begins its investigation. The NTSB must also sift through a “very large package of information” provided by the FAA, said Inman, the NTSB member.\nThe NTSB aims to issue a preliminary report on the collision in the next 30 days and a final report will be issued once the investigation is complete, Inman said.\n“Our investigative team will be on scene as long as it takes in order to obtain all of the perishable evidence and all of the fact-finding that is needed to bring us to a conclusion of probable cause,” Inman said.\nWednesday’s collision is thedeadliest aviation disaster in the USsince November 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in New York, killing all 260 people on board.\nOf those on board Wednesday’s flight, 60 were passengers and four were crew members, American Airlines told CNN.\nThe Pentagon is withholding the names of the Black Hawk’s three crew members until next of kin are notified, Hegseth said. The crew included a young captain, a staff sergeant and a CW-2 chief warrant officer, he said. CNN affiliateWSBidentified one of the crew members as Ryan O’Hara.\n“It was a fairly experienced crew that was doing an annual required night evaluation,” Hegseth said.\nSimilarly, the two pilots aboard Flight 5342 were not newcomers to complex commercial flights, the company’s CEO said.\n“These are experienced pilots,” said Isom. “I know that the captain had … almost six years with PSA (Airlines), and the first officer almost two years.”\nOfficials in Wichita, Kansas, do not know how many passengers were local residents and how many were traveling through the city, they said at a news conference Thursday. ButKansas Sen. Jerry Moran described the crash as “a very personal circumstance” for Kansans.\n“We’re going to know people who are on this flight, know their family members,” Moran said.\nThe manifest, managed by American Airlines, will be disseminated through their official sources and the National Transportation Safety Board, said Director of Airports in Wichita Jesse Romo.\nResidents of Georgia, Virginia and Ohio are among the dead. includingthree students and 6 parentsfrom Virginia’s Fairfax County Public School system, the superintendent confirmed.\nOhio college student Grace Maxwell, who was from Wichita, Kansas, died in the crash, according to Cedarville University. Georgians Ryan O’Hara and Sam Lilley were also killed, Gov. Brian Kemp said.\n“Several members” of the US figure skating community were on board the flight after participating in events related to the US Figure Skating Championships in Kansas, the sport’s national governing body confirmed. They included Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who were the 1994 world figure skating champions in pairs. They represented Russia but moved to the US, where they launched successful coaching careers.\nSkater Jinna Han and her mother, Jin Han, were also killed, along with skater Spencer Lane and his mother Christine Lane, according to the Skating Club of Boston.\nThere were Russians aboard the downed American Airlines flight, Trump said, adding there were “some other countries represented.”\nThe US State Department has “reached out to the foreign diplomatic community to let them know we will be in contact as soon as we have confirmation via the NTSB of foreign national casualties,” a spokesperson told CNN.\nAmerican Airlines shared atoll-free numberand said families of people who were onboard Flight 5342 should call 1-800-679-8215 for information. The NTSB also planned to providea briefingfor families on Thursday.\nThe airspace over Reagan National Airport is among the busiest in the country, and passenger planes frequently share the airspace with helicopters.\nAt least three incidents of close calls involving helicopters near the airport have been reported in the past three years.\nOn two occasions, passenger planes had to take evasive maneuvers to avoid colliding with a helicopter when trying to land at the airport according to theNASA ASR database, which records self-reported incidents by aviation personnel. The third involved two helicopters.\nThe reports are filed anonymously, without referring specific airlines. None of the incidents involved the runway approach from Wednesday’s collision.\nThe most recent report details an incident in April 2024, in which a helicopter came within several hundred feet of a passenger plane trying to land at DCA after air traffic control failed to notify the plane’s pilots of the helicopter’s location.\n“Need to have better separation for DCA traffic on the river,” the anonymous air carrier captain reported.\nVirginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner had previously raised concerns about the dangers of the packed airspace, especially as other senators pushed to add more flights to the airport.\n“I’ve been very, very concerned about this very complex airspace,” Kaine said. “The security demands of being the nation’s capital puts some significant restrictions on it.”\nCNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Haley Britzkey, Gabe Cohen, Aaron Cooper, Aaron Eggleston, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Alejandra Jaramillo, Ross Levitt, Oren Liebermann, Jamiel Lynch, Mary Kay Mallonee, Pete Muntean, Hanna Park, Helen Regan, Taylor Romine, Brian Rokus, Robert Shackelford, Christian Sierra, Alexandra Skores, Alex Stambaugh, Morgan Rimmer, Majlie de Puy Kamp, Karina Tsui, Juan Carlos Lopez, Zenebou Sylla and Eric Levenson contributed reporting."

            "text": "Japanese authorities haveasked hundreds of residents near Tokyo to evacuate as asinkholeat an intersection grew to more than 40 meters wide, hampering rescuers racing to reach an elderly truck driver whose vehicle was swallowed by the hole.\nOn Tuesday, part of a road intersection in Saitama prefecture, about 18 miles north ofJapan’s capital, opened up, swallowing a three-ton truck and its driver, a 74-year-old man, prompting a rescue mission now in its fourth day.\nThe pit has expanded to 40 meters wide – four times its width when it first appeared, a local official told CNN on Friday.\n“The inside is gouging and it’s getting bigger every day,” the official from Saitama Prefecture’s Sewerage Works Division said.\nRescuers have used cranes to lift part of the truck out of the hole and have sent drones underground but have not been able to communicate with the truck driver since Tuesday.\nAuthorities believe that corroded sewer pipes may have caused the earth to fall in. Leaking wastewater may have further eroded the surrounding soil, widening the chasm, they said.\nTwo hundred households have been asked to evacuate from the areasince Tuesday, local authorities said.\nLocal authorities also asked 1.2 million residents to refrain from bathing and doing laundry in a bid to cut down on wastewater, which could further complicate rescue efforts in the fragile area.\nThesudden opening of the earth has sparked fears among somein the densely-populated region about the labyrinth of ageing pipes beneath their homes and businesses.\n“I live close to the area, and I’ve been watching all the news footage. The moment the hole widens was really scary,” said oneuser on the social media platform, X.\nThe Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism told CNN Friday that it has ordered emergency inspections of similar sewer pipes across Saitama and six other prefectures, home to around 39 million people.\nSinkholes are most common in areas underlain by rocks like gypsum, limestone and other carbonate rocks, which can be naturally dissolved by groundwater, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\nMuch of the state ofFloridais underlain by limestone, making it extremely susceptible to the phenomena, USGS noted.\nRelated articleMassive sinkhole threatens to swallow West Virginia police department\nTakashi Oguchi, a geographer﻿ from the University of Tokyo, said sinkholes are rare in Japan, where most roads are built on unconsolidated fluvial and marine sediments.\nBut he warned that when a large underground waterpipe ruptures, leaked water could wash away these sediments, creating a sinkhole.\nMuch of Japan’s public infrastructure was built between the 1960s and 1970s during an economic boom in the wake of World War II, during which much of Tokyo was destroyed by American bombing raids.\nThe sewage system in question in the Saitama prefecture is about 42 years old.\n“We will have such events more in the future because the decay of underground pipes is ongoing little by little, and many pipes are located below roads,” Oguchi said.\nReiko Kuwano,a civil engineering professorfrom Tokyo University, said inspecting pipes buried deep underground is always a challenge.\nAt the traffic intersection in Saitama on Friday, rescuers raced to reach the driver trapped for days meters below the tarmac.\nThe mission has proven difficult so far, the official from Sewerage Works Division told CNN.\nHe said the original hole that brought down the driver had merged witha secondsinkholenearby, resulting in the expansion of the sinkhole.\nThe driver was “buried in earth and sand, and if we bring heavy equipment near the asphalt it might fall in,” he said.\nHe said rescue workers are planning to build a ramp to bring the heavy equipment from an angle.\n“We’re working hard building the ramp and aiming to get it built by today,” he said."

            "text": "“You have to make a decision. Do you want to have the party of [Chancellor] Olaf Scholz and all those eunuchs? Or are you on our side, with Elon Musk and Donald Trump? Which side has more sex appeal?”\nThis was Maximilian Krah, a highly controversial andoutspoken,far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) politician speaking to CNN in Halle, eastern Germany, last month. His comments, came as the AfD launched their national election campaign in front of 4,000 supporters.\nMinutes later, Musk made a surprise video appearance beamed into the conference center. There was plenty of love in the room for Trump and his new administration from senior party officials.\nThe AfD has been riding high in the polls and could finish second in elections later this month.\nSome of the rhetoric from Halle begs the question: is the AfD infatuated with Trump? And if so, why? The traffic has largely been one way – Musk aside, the new US president himself hasn’t spoken about the election or the party, which appears determined to forge an alliance.\nAnd perhaps for good reason. Both the US and Germany have similar issues of mass migration and economic headwinds. And both parties have laid the blame for those issues at the feet of the governing class of ‘liberal’ parties, in their words.\nParty leaderAlice Weidel, speaking to CNN as she came off stage in Halle, went out of her way to wish the best for the new administration in Washington. “I wish [Elon Musk], Donald Trump and JD Vance all the best blessings for their next tenure,” she said.\nTino Chrupalla, the AfD co-leader, who attended the Capital One rally in Washington on inauguration day, also spoke in glowing terms about the US president.\nAddressing the crowd before Weidel, he said, “You could feel the optimism and hope in the president. The American people felt liberated.” Chrupalla added: “He (Trump) implemented his election promises… That’s what I call politics for the people.”\nMatthais Quent is a researcher and author on extremism, in particular the AfD and Germany’s far right. He says the attention from Musk is unchartered territory for the party, and they are harnessing it to their benefit.\nThe party has seized on an opportunity to normalize themselves, using the Trump administration as their yardstick. “To see the biggest power in the world has a far-right leadership, this tells them, ‘okay, we can achieve this goal as well,’” Quent said in an interview with CNN.\nNot every observer would agree with the assessment of Trump’s administration, but certainly, there is considerable overlap both in policy and in strategy.\n“It’s nationalism, it’s populism, it’s anti-immigration, it’s disruption,” Quent says.\nAcross Europe there has been a wave of far-right parties coming to power on largely populist platforms. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, is a longtime Trump supporter and welcomed his return to office.\nRobert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia, who also survived an assassination attempt last year, has openly said his policies align closely with those of Trump.\nAs for the Musk-AfD alliance, Quent thinks they are flattered by his interest and are seizing an opportunity.\n“The AfD has never had such open support by a whole government, or by a guy next to the government. They had support form very rich people in Europe and from Germany, but it was hidden and not public… he helps them to be seen as a normal political party which is the narrative of all far-right populist movements in the world,” Quent said.\nAt the campaign event in Halle, Musk repeated a common trope of his in this election, saying the AfD is Germany’s “best hope” before adding, “it’s good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything.”\nMusk also caused controversy this week as commemorations of the80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitzcamp complex were held.\nThe billionaire said there’s “too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that.”\nMusk’s remarks mirrored the AfD’s long-held position that Germany should stop atoning for crimes committed by the Nazis in the past.\nThe comments irked Scholz, who called Musk’s words “disgusting.”\nHowever, Quent questions how much Musk’s involvement is translating to support in the polls. He believes the AfD’s rise may be more accurately attributed to the weakness of the government and how social debates are focusing on the hot-button AfD issues, such as immigration.\nCurrently polling at roughly 21% would make the AfD the second largest political force in Germany and the first far-right party in that position since the Nazi era.\nBut the reality is they are likely to be frozen out of government. There has long been an agreement between Germany’s larger parties to refuse forming a government or passing laws with AfD assistance - it’s known as the “firewall.”\nHowever, debates on tighter immigration legislation held this week in the Bundestag and, particularly a vote on Friday called the “influx limitation act” have been spearheaded by the favorite for chancellor, Friedrich Merz of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\nThe moves show the kind of impact the AfD are having on the campaign and major parties. Merz lost the vote on Friday, handing what people see as a victory for the AfD and a dent to his own campaign.\nRegardless of how German voters may see the involvement from the US, Quent says, “in general, [the AfD leadership] are in favor of Trump, and they feel and they have a momentum right now.”"

This sentencing has now been postponed.\nIn 2023, Momikatold CNNthat he had come to Sweden from Iraq in 2018.\nHe said he had carried out the demonstrations because he believed the Quran “should be banned in the world because of the danger it causes to democracy, ethics, human values, human rights, and women’s rights. It just doesn’t work in this time and age.”\nSwedish authorities had at first attempted to prevent Momika from staging protests by denying him a police permit to demonstrate. This decision was later overturned by Stockholm’s Court of Appeals, citing freedom of speech.\nAn account on X purporting to be Momika regularly posted updates on his 2025 trial to more than 230,000 followers. The account also regularly posted anti-Islam sentiments.\nEarlier this month, the account was asking for donations to go towards a lawyer, who would reportedly help Momika gain asylum in the United States.\nA prosecutor will now be in charge of investigating the murder, the Stockholm police spokesperson said.\nSecurity services will also be involved in the investigation, as there is a risk that Momika’s murder could be linked to foreign powers, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press briefing Thursday, according to public broadcaster SVT.\nCNN’s Henrik Pettersson and Lindsay Isaac contributed reporting."

            "text": "Before American Eagle Flight 5342 took to the air from Wichita, Kansas, Wednesday evening, on its way to the nation’s capital, figure skater Spencer Lane snapped a photo of the plane’s wing stretched out over the tarmac toward the horizon.\nA grayish-blue overcast sky formed a shimmery curtain over the setting sun in the image the teenager posted to his Instagram Stories. The up-and-coming skater wrote “ICT->DCA,” referencing the airport codes for the departure and destination cities.\nLane, his mother as well as other budding skating stars, their families and coaches from the US and Russia awaited their departure after attending the US Figure Skating Championships and a development camp for young athletes.\nRelated articleIs flying still safe? Here’s what experts say\nIn all, 60 passengers and four crew members were on board the commercial jet when it took off at 5:39 p.m.\nThe two-hour, 35-minute journey would deliver them to one of the country’s most congested and complicated flight approaches, a runway at Reagan National Airport, just south of the capital’s brightly illuminated marble monuments.\nIt ended as the deadliest US aviation disaster in nearly a quarter century.\nOn a clear night, the nearly full Bombardier CRJ700 jet approached Runway 33 around 8:48 p.m. when it collided midair with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter carrying a crew of three on a training flight. Videos captured a giant red-orange fireball, followed by an eerie trail of smoke and burning debris. The two aircraft plunged into the dark, frigid Potomac River. No one survived.\nThevictims represent a cross section of the legions who traverse America’s congested airwayson any given day, including a biology professor and popular soldiers, longtime airline pilots and flight attendants, union steamfitters returning from a hunting trip, an attorney and a pair of young associates, along with the aspiring figure skating stars, their family members and coaches.\nTimothy Lilley, whose son, Sam Lilley, was the first officer on American Airlines Flight 5342, said he spent 20 years as a helicopter pilot in the Army. Both he and his son shared a passion for flying. Now, Lilley toldFox 5 Atlanta, he has to reconcile that passion with the cause of his son’s death.\n“It hurts me because those are my brothers,” he said of the Army helicopter crew. “Now my son is dead.”\nAt Reagan National Airport, Hamaad Raza received a text message from his wife: The flight was about 20 minutes from touching down. He later showed the message to a reporter for CNN affiliate WUSA.\nAs Flight 5342 made its subsequent descent just miles south of the White House, the UH-60 Black Hawk flew at a low altitude along what is known as Route 4. The flight path hugs the eastern shore of the Potomac and is reserved as a special corridor for law enforcement, medevac, military, and government helicopters. Helicopters in the corridor must be at or below 200 feet above sea level.\nThe military helicopter may have been flying outside its approved flight path, at a higher altitude than it was supposed to be, and at least half a mile off the approved route, theNew York Times reported.\nMembers of the US Army’s12th Aviation Battalion’sBravo company – based in Fort Belvoir, Virginia – the soldiers on board had experience with the crowded and tightly controlled airspace over DC.\nRelated articleA groom-to-be pilot, a daughter of Indian immigrants and figure skating champions are among DC air collision victims\nThe helicopter pilot and co-pilot had at least 1,500 hours of flight time between them – a significant amount, according to a senior Army official, considering their average flights are around two hours. Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, described the soldiers as “a fantastic crew. Very experienced at what they were doing.”\nThe two pilots at the controls of Flight 5342 were also experienced. The captain had been flying with PSA Airlines – which operated the flight for parent carrier American – for nearly six years, according to company CEO Robert Isom. The first officer had nearly two years with the airline.\nAbout 8:43 p.m. Wednesday, an air traffic controller at Reagan National contacted the commercial jet.\n“Can you take Runway 33?” the controller asked, directing the jet to a shorter runway that intersects the busy main runway.\n“Yeah, we can do 33,” the pilot responded.\n“Can confirm Runway 33, Runway 33 cleared to land …”\nThe soldiers on the Black Hawk were conducting what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described as an annual nighttime training on “a continuity of government mission.” The missions are routine: In the event of a catastrophe, helicopters are often employed to usher government officials to safety. Crew members had night vision goggles, the defense secretary said.\nThe Black Hawk flew past the Lincoln Memorial and over the Tidal Basin. As the inky black Potomac spread out below the helicopter, an air traffic controller at Reagan National contacted the military pilot.\n“Do you have the CRJ in sight?” the air traffic controller asked, referring to the regional jet. The controller instructed the military aircraft to look out for the jet.\nRelated articleA visual timeline of the collision between a passenger plane and a Black Hawk helicopter in DC\nBefore the pilot responded, the controller instructed the helicopter to “pass behind the CRJ,” according to a feed of the air traffic communication.\n“Pat-25 has aircraft in sight,” the helicopter pilot responded with his call signal. He requested “visual separation,” meaning he would visually maintain a safe distance from the jet. The tower confirmed and granted the pilot permission to visually navigate and avoid Flight 5342.\nThat final communication was followed by more than 10 seconds of silence before the giant fireball erupted above the Potomac. The audio captured audible gasps, including a loud “oooh” in the background.\n“Oh, my!” someone is heard saying in the background of radio transmissions. Air traffic controllers are heard scrambling to direct jets to nearby airports.\n“Tower, did you see that?” the pilot of one aircraft is heard asking on the radio transmission.\n“Looks like there were flares up in the air,” a pilot reported to the tower at one point.\n“We’re handling that right now,” the controller responded.\nAn unknown pilot told the tower he saw “flares from the opposite side of the Potomac.”\n“Apparently both aircraft involved are in the river,” the controller said later.\nAt the time of the collision, one air traffic controller was working two different tower positions, handling both local and helicopter traffic, an air traffic control source told CNN. The source said the setup was not uncommon. An internal preliminary Federal Aviation Administration report, however, said staffing was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,”The New York Times reported.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the collision, has recovered both the flight data and cockpit voice recorders – known as the black boxes – from the jet. The helicopter’s flight data and voice recorder - combined in one black box – has also been recovered.\nAfter weeks of icy temperatures in the region, Wednesday night felt comparatively balmy. Jimmy Mazel, 17, and his girlfriend decided to eat dinner at Gravelly Point Park in Arlington, Virginia. Located just north of Reagan National, the park is a popular destination to watch arriving and departing planes soar overhead. An evening of dining and plane-spotting was interrupted, he said, by “a white light falling out of the sky.”\nNearby, Roy Best was standing on his building’s rooftop when he heard a loud noise and saw a bright light flare in the distance.\n“I turned to the side and I saw like a big spark,” he said. “And then, you know, just something falling.”\nRelated articleA trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision\nAt first, Best said, he thought it might have been fireworks. A little later he learned the truth.\nWhen a direct line with Reagan National Airport rang that Wednesday night, David Hoagland, president of the Washington DC Firefighters Local 36, said first responders expected a routine report of a flight in distress. Instead, they heard: “Crash! Crash! Crash!” he recalled.\nAs members of the union rushed to a pier to board a fireboat, burning debris rained down over the Potomac. First responders arrived to find wreckage submerged in the shallow water and almost immediately started finding victims, Hoagland said. Some plane passengers were still strapped in their seats, but removing them proved difficult as sharp pieces of debris ripped the wetsuits worn by first responders.\nThe plane was found upside-down in three sections in shallow water – including the partly submerged wing and mangled fuselage. The helicopter wreckage was also found.\nGravelly Point Park, the destination for plane watchers, is now the site of a makeshift morgue.\nAt least 41 bodies – 28 of those remains identified – have been recovered from the murky depths of the Potomac, withnear-zero visibility in the water and other difficult conditionshampering the search effort. The plane’s fuselage will need to be removed so the remaining bodies can be retrieved, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said.\nClouds and cold rain rolled in on Friday – as flights landed and took off and search crews continued their work – magnifying the pall the tragedy has cast over the city and the nation.\nCNN’s Pete Muntean, Aaron Cooper, Andy Rose, Sara Smart, Aaron Eggleston, Dalia Faheid, Emma Tucker, Amanda Jackson, Robert Shackelford, Jamiel Lynch, Karina Tsui, Jillian Sykes, Alexandra Skores, Haley Britzky, Katie Bo Lillis, Michael Williams, David Williams, Holly Yan, Antoinette Radford, George Ramsay, Justin Lear, Taylor Galgano, Zenebou Sylla and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report."

            "text": "Investigators are intensifying their search into what caused the collision between American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army Black Hawk helicopter, with recovery crews still working to pull wreckage from the Potomac Riverand initial concerns already raised about the path of at least one of the aircraft.\nThe helicopter was on atraining missionwhen itcollided Wednesday nightwith a commercial plane that was on approach to land at Washington’s Reagan National Airport, killing all 64 aboard the plane and the three soldiers in the helicopter, officials have said.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the cause, will take about 30 days to release a preliminary report, and a final report, which will determine a probable cause, will take much longer, itsaid. Still, details about the collision’s circumstances and potential avenues for the investigation are emerging. Here’s what we know:\nThe Black Hawk had beenusingspecialized corridors utilized by law enforcement, medevac, military and government helicopters in the Washington area. Federal Aviation Administration charts show helicopters in the corridor must be at or below 200 feet above sea level.\nRelated articlePilots had reported near-misses with helicopters at Reagan National Airport in the years before the deadly crash\nBut flight tracking data from the moments before Wednesday’s fatal midair collisionappear to showthe Black Hawk flying 100 feet above its allowed altitude, and veering off the prescribed route along the Potomac River’s east side.\nThe helicopter’s turns would have put the Black Hawk closer to the airport than the standard route.\n“Based on the data we’re able to see, I think that’s a fair assessment,” said Ian Petchenik, spokesperson for FlightRadar24, a flight tracking company.\nPetchenik cautioned that the flight tracking data for the Black Hawk is imperfect. The military helicopter was sending a Mode S signal, which transmits basic data about altitude and aircraft identification. The American Airlines flight was broadcasting an ADS-B signal, which provides far more information to air traffic control.\n“ADS-B is worlds beyond the standard Mode S data. Mode S data allows you to have just a few bits of information,” Petchenik told CNN.\nA full understanding of the moments before the midair collision will require a complete analysis of the data recorders on board the aircraft, but even an incomplete picture indicates the helicopter was not in the right position.\nBoth President Donald Trump and the nation’s defense secretary raised the issue of altitude on Friday morning.\n“The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit,” Trump said in aTruth Social postFriday. It was not immediately clear if the president was getting the information from official investigators or reiterating what he was seeing in news reports.\n“Someone was at the wrong altitude,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News on Friday morning.  “Was the Black Hawk too high? Was it on course? Right now, we don’t quite know.”\nAt the point of the collision, only about 300 feet separate the approved paths of the jet and the helicopter, CNN aviation analyst and pilot Miles O’Briensaid Thursday.\n“That’s a very tight, no-margin-for-error airspace arrangement and demands that everybody in that spot be completely on their toes and fly to complete perfection,” he said.\nInvestigators now must determine whether a change of a couple of hundred feet might have been one thing that could have prevented the deadliest US aviation incident in two decades.\nWith the probe underway, the FAA is indefinitely closing the low-altitude helicopter corridor that was being used when the crash happened, an officialtold CNN Friday. Informal discussions are also beginning in Washington about changing helicopter routes on the Potomac River, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\nThe NTSB will look at the“human, machine and the environment”to determine the cause of the deadly collision, board Chair Jennifer Homendy said Thursday, in response to a question about whether diversity initiatives would be considered in the investigation after Trumpraised the issue.\nThe flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder — known as black boxes — from the American Airlines plane have been recovered, the NTSB told CNN. The helicopter’s black box voice recorder has also been recovered with no signs of exterior damage, according to NTSB member Todd Inman.\nA source familiar with the investigation told CNN investigators could provide “high-level readouts” from the recorders as soon as Saturday. The new details could provide key early clues about the altitude of both aircraft.\nInman added that they have begun interviewing air traffic control personnel, which will continue for a few days. The interviews will be used to match with other data the NTSB is receiving.\nVideo obtained exclusively by CNNshows no sign of evasive action being taken by either aircraft, running directly into each other in a horrifying blast of light, their wreckage falling into the dark water of the Potomac.\nRelated videoExclusive: CNN obtains videos showing new angles of DC plane crash\nYet before the crash, air traffic control operators directed the helicopter to pass behind the passenger plane, according to air traffic controlleraudioobtained by CNN from LiveATC.net.\nAn air traffic controller addressed the helicopter: “PAT 2-5 do you have the CRJ in sight?” CRJ refers to the American Airlines plane, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet.\nThe controller then said, “PAT 2-5 pass behind the CRJ.”\nAdditional air traffic control audio shortly before the collision captures the helicopter pilot saying, “PAT 2-5 has aircraft in sight, request visual separation.”\nThe crash raises questions about whether the helicopter crew was looking at different aircraft or whether the crew misjudged the position of the plane, mistaking other lights for the aircraft the helicopter crew had been instructed to track, as seen in video, according to Mary Schiavo, an aviation analyst and former inspector general of the Department of Transportation.\n“We do see other lights in the area, particularly one bright light from another aircraft, when the air traffic control tower asked the helicopter, ‘Do you have the plane in sight?’” SchiavotoldCNN’s Kasie Hunt on Friday.\nThe voice recorders from both aircraft could reveal information about what the pilots saw and what they were trying to do, according to Michael McCormick, a former FAA air traffic manager who’s also an associate professor in air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n“If we could just know what the pilots thought they were looking at and what they thought they were avoiding, that would make a big difference in terms of this investigation,” McCormick told CNN Saturday.\nQuestions also are being raised about whether the helicopter was adequately staffed in the crowded airspace.\nThe Black Hawk was on a routine training mission out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, with an instructor, a captain in training and a crew chief, the Army said.\nElizabeth McCormick, a former Black Hawk pilot,toldCNN’s Jake Tapper Thursday that having a crew of three on the ill-fated flight was inadequate, asserting that such a crew couldn’t see in all directions.\n“You only have visibility from the front 180 degrees. Your crew chiefs clear the back,” McCormick said. “If you only have one crew chief, how much can you clear? I think that was a major issue.”\nEven if the helicopter were at a proper level, the crew still would have needed to be able to have visual contact with all nearby aircraft. “Obviously, ultimately the aircraft has to pass through this 200-foot altitude in order to land,” former commercial pilot Jeff Huddleston said.\nOn the night of the crash, one controller at Reagan National was performing duties than can be performed by two separate air traffic controllers – handling both local plane and helicopter traffic –an air traffic control source told CNN.\nRelated articleA groom-to-be pilot, a daughter of Indian immigrants and figure skating champions are among DC air collision victims\nThe source described the set-up, which had one person handling both local and helicopter traffic, as not uncommon.\nHowever, a preliminary Federal Aviation Administration internal report said staffing was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,” according to theNew York Times.\nThe union that represents air traffic controllers cautioned against assuming that the combined role would make conditions unsafe.\n“This is an extremely complex job that we do day in and day out with weather changes, with flow changes, and with airspace changes each and every day,” National Air Traffic Controllers Association president Nick Daniels told CNN’s Erin Burnett, “so, it’s not uncommon for positions to be combined or not combined at all.”\nChronic staffing issues at its radar facilities have plagued the FAA. Following the pandemic, it has been scrambling to get more controllers trained and certified. The Trump Administration has offered a separation package to federal workers, including air traffic controllers, which could cause further staffing shortages.\nEven as more information comes to light, some officials who have been briefed on the disaster say there’s still much we don’t know.\nUS Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a former Black Hawk pilot, spoke to investigators with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board Thursday.\n“I asked them to provide me with some more information – which they will – including the transcripts of the air traffic control instructions back to the pilots,”she told CNN.\nThe senator added that, despite the complexity of flying around Washington, DC, this seems to have started as a routine situation.\n“I flew out of (Chicago) Midway Airport for over a dozen years where I did routinely fly underneath commercial airliners landing there at Midway Airport,” said Duckworth. “This is not an abnormal flight profile to be in, although it is a very congested airspace.”\nCNN’s Andy Rose wrote this story from Atlanta with reporting from CNN’s Pete Muntean in Washington and CNN’s Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon.

            "text": "Seven people are dead, including one in a car on the ground, after a twin-engine medevac jet carrying a child patient and her mother crashed in a neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia Friday night, the mayor said Saturday morning. At least 19 were injured on the ground.\nThe six people on the plane were Mexican nationals, Mexico’s president said Saturday morning.\n“I mourn the death of six Mexicans in the plane crash in Philadelphia, United States,” Claudia Sheinbaum said. “The consular authorities are in permanent contact with the families; I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to support them in whatever way is required. My solidarity with their loved ones and friends.”\nThe plane crash, about 150 miles to the northeast of the Washington, DC, area came as authoritiescontinue their probeinto Wednesday’s deadly collision there. An American Airlines regional jetcarrying 64 peopleand a US Army Black Hawk helicopter with three soldiers onboard collided over the Potomac River. All are presumed dead.\nThe Learjet 55 crashed after departing from Northeast Philadelphia Airport en route to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri, the Federal Aviation Administration told CNN.\nOn board were a pediatric patient and her mother returning home to Mexico after the child had been treated in Philadelphia, said Shai Gold, spokesperson for flight operator Jet Rescue Air Ambulance. The girl was being treated for an illness at Shriners Children’s Hospital in northeast Philadelphia, city officials said Saturday.\nFour crew members – a pilot, co-pilot, paramedic and doctor – were also on board the flight, which was scheduled to stop for refueling at the Springfield airport before continuing to its final destination of Tijuana, Mexico, Gold told CNN.\nRelated articleExclusive: NTSB fought to retain employees after Trump’s federal worker resignation offer\nInvestigators were still searching Saturday for the jet’s cockpit voice recorder as they work to collect evidence and piece together what may have led to the crash, according to National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy.\n“It could be intact, but likely…it is damaged, it may be fragmented,” Homendy said at a Saturday news conference.\n“We have an incredible team at our headquarters, our Office of Research and Engineering, who have significant expertise on repairing damaged cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders,” Homendy said.\nAs part of the evidence gathering process, the board is also collecting debris from the site of the crash and have located the aircraft’s two engines. Homendy asked community members who find debris to reach out to the NTSB.\nThe area of impact from the crash is roughly four to six blocks, and officials have discovered debris around the city, Philadelphia’s managing director Adam Thiel said at a news conference earlier Saturday. “It’s a very widespread area and we’re still trying to determine the entire scope.”\n“It is entirely possible there will be changes to those casualty figures,” Thiel said. “It will likely be days or more until we are able to definitively answer the question about the number of folks who perished in this tragedy.”\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker urged residents who may have been in the area during the explosion to check their vehicles and property for potential evidence.\n“Don’t touch it, just call 911,” she said.\nThe plane took off just after 6 p.m. ET and reached 1,650 feet before plunging, according to data from ADS-B Exchange. The data shows the final speed of descent was 11,000 feet per minute.\n“The entire flight lasted less than a minute,” Ralph Hicks, a senior NTSB investigator, said Saturday.\nAs an air traffic controller tries to contact the plane, there’s a callout, heard on LiveATC.net, “Medevac med service, northeast tower. Medevac med service, northeast tower. Are you on frequency?”\nA little over a minute later, the controller is heard saying: “We have a lost aircraft.”\nThe medical transport plane crashed in a residential neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia, engulfing five homes and multiple vehicles in flames and covering the area with debris, city officials said.\nMore than 150 firefighters rushed to the scene after three alarms quickly went off. Video from CNN affiliate WPVI showed flames and a large cloud of smoke in the neighborhood as several fire trucks responded to the crash.\nJefferson Health received 15 victims after the crash, a spokesperson said. Twelve have since been discharged, two have been admitted for further care and one patient was transferred to another hospital.\nSix patients were sent to Temple University Hospital-Jeanes Campus and all have since been released as of Saturday afternoon, a spokesperson from the hospital confirmed to CNN. One patient was at the hospital’s main campus in “fair condition,” the spokesperson said.\nSt. Christopher’s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia received one pediatric patient from Friday’s crash, a spokesperson told CNN.\nNearby, the Northeast Philadelphia Airport was temporarily closed following the crash, but is now reopened, the airport told CNN.\nAcross the street from the crash, Roosevelt Mall was evacuated, mall spokesperson Kristen Moore told CNN. There were no injuries or damage at the mall, she said.\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he is offering all Commonwealth resources as the emergency response unfolds. Sen. John Fetterman also wrote on social media that he was in touch with the Philadelphia mayor and awaiting further information.\nSen. Dave McCormicksaidhe is “closely monitoring the tragic situation,” adding that he has reached out to the mayor and local law enforcement to lend “full support.”\nMembers of the state’s emergency management agency and transportation department are on the ground, along with 45 state troopers, Shapiro told reporters Friday night. The state’s environmental protection department is also making sure that hazardous materials “are addressed,” Shapiro said.\nThe FAA and NTSB investigators are on scene, according to US Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n“The impact was so devastating, I think they’re going to have their hands full,” Peter Goelz, former managing director of the NTSB, told CNN Saturday.\nWhile there’s some video available of the incident, none of it so far is particularly clear, Goelz said.\n“The only tip-off might be if something came off the plane earlier and is a little further down the flight track,” Goelz said. “That might help indicate what happened, because the first piece off is the most important.”\nPresident Donald Trump has been briefed on the crash, Duffy said in apost on X.\n“So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,” Trump said ina Truth Social post. “More innocent souls lost. Our people are totally engaged. First Responders are already being given credit for doing a great job.”\nOne witness who saw the crash was at work when he noticed “this big ball of flames in the sky,” he told CNN affiliateWPVI.\n“I was right here at the job and all I could see is this big ball of flames in the sky. Literally, we heard a loud, loud bang. It shook the entire building, the whole building shook,” Mikey Littlejohn told WPVI.\nAnother witness, Vadim Osipov, said: “I was in shock. I’m still in shock. Like, this is insane.”\nOsipov said the incident reminded him of the war in Ukraine, where he is from. “There’s always rockets coming in and stuff like that, then I see things flying.”\nGov. Shapiro said that while Friday’s incident was “an awful aviation disaster,” it shows the unified response of local, state and federal officials.\n“We saw neighbor helping neighbor,” he said. “We know that there will be loss in this region and we want to offer our thoughts and our serious prayers for those who are grieving.”\nRed Cross Philadelphiasaida team of disaster workers is on the scene to assist those who have been displaced.

            "category": "world",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "(CNN) —From fresh avocados to dairy products, Americans rely heavily on their bordering countries for everyday grocery items. The White House confirmed that President Donald Trump willimpose a 25% tariffon goods from Mexico and Canada— two of the largest suppliers of agricultural products to the US — on February 1. These tariffscould drive up foodpricesfor the average shopper, at a time when rising grocery costs are already a concern for many American families.\nThe two countries supply a significant share of several key food categories. For example, Mexico is the largest supplier of fruit and vegetables to the US, while Canada leads in exports of grain, livestock and meats, poultry and more.\nHere’s what the US depends on most from its closest neighbors and trading partners.\nWhile the White House confirmed plans to impose new tariffs on Mexico and Canada, it remains unclear whether all products would be affected. The president has previouslysuggestedthat the tariffs might target specific industries, such as pharmaceuticals or steel.\nAgricultural products from Mexico and Canada, in particular, could become more expensive for consumers, as grocery retailers operate on thinner profit margins than most industries. With little room to absorb higher tariff costs, the grocers may have to pass them on to shoppers.\nAlthough the US typically exports more agricultural goods than it imports, the value of imports have increased faster than that of exports in the past decade,according to the Department of Agriculture. Additionally, climate change has increased US reliance on countries like Mexico, wheregrowing conditions are more favorable.\nFor decades, Mexico and Canada have been major players in feeding America. Together, the countries accounted for nearly $83 billion of the total $196 billion in agricultural goods the US imported between January and November of last year, according to USDA data. The European Union, Brazil and China are also key suppliers of agricultural imports.\nBeyond food, Mexico and Canada are also among the US’s largest trade partners overall. The US imported around $467 billion and $337 billion in goods from Mexico and Canada last year, respectively, through November, the most recent month of available data, according to federal trade data from the Commerce Department.\nThey rank in the top three countries for total goods the US imports. Some of the top goods the US relies on from them include vehicles and vehicle parts, oil and electronics.\nCNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report."

            "title": "This AI technology was supposed to detect guns in school. Here’s what happened outside Nashville | CNN",
            "category": "world",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "A Nashville school district invested about $1 million in AI gun identification software, the school district said, leaving some to wonder what went wrong in detecting a school shooter in the halls.\nMore than a week ago, 17-year-old Solomon Henderson carried out ashootinginside Antioch High School in suburban Nashville, killing a classmate and wounding another. Henderson died after turning the gun on himself, police said.\nRelated video‘She was my girl’: Aunt tearfully describes student killed in school shooting\nThe gun detection system at the school failed to detect Henderson’s weapon during the January 22 shooting because he was too far away from the surveillance cameras used to identify a weapon and activate an alarm, according to district officials. Meanwhile, the system’s CEO says the gun could not be detected because it was not visible.\nThe gun detection technology, called Omnilert, was deployed at all the schools in the district in February 2024 to bolster security, a spokesperson for Metro Nashville Public Schools told CNN.\nUsing AI technology, the system can identify a gun threat before shots are fired so local law enforcement can respond more quickly, and purportedly, prevent a tragedy from happening,according to the company’s website. But it’s only one tool that can be used in conjunction with other measures.\nOmnilert’s software is relatively new and doesn’t work perfectly all the time, according to the company’s CEO, Dave Fraser, who earlier expressed his condolences to the school and community. And while there is no harm in implementing the technology if a school board can spare the cash, gun safety and surveillance experts say there is no concrete evidence gun detection software is effective at preventing school shootings.\nHere’s how the technology works, what experts say went wrong and whether prevention is possible.\nAs the constant threat of mass shootings persists, school districts across the United States have invested countless dollars intosafety measuresto keep would-be shooters out of the classroom – a crime prevention technique known as target hardening.\nGun detection software, like Omnitech, is the latest target hardening resource to hit the market, said Chad Marlow, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on privacy and school surveillance technology issues.\n“There’s no intervention that is guaranteed to prevent a school shooting. If so, we’d all be using it,” Marlow told CNN. “But there are some that may have a positive benefit.”\nAt most schools, surveillance cameras are used to keep an eye on any possible threats, according to Fraser. While helpful, these cameras are only useful after a tragedy has occurred and footage is used to work out how the incident unfolded, he added.\nComparatively, the AI technology used in Omnilert’s Gun Detect software is trained to watch surveillance video for weapons in real time, Fraser told CNN in an emailed statement. These cameras are monitored by AI technology 24 hours a day, seven days a week, he said. CNN asked the company how many school districts are using the product but has not heard back.\n“If a gun becomes visible it is detected in less than a second and the detection information – a picture and a short video of the person with the potential gun, the location of the camera and the building – is sent to a human to make a verification that this is a real threat,” Fraser told CNN by email.\nIn most cases, the technology initiates an emergency response in less than 20 seconds after a weapon is detected, Fraser said. Ideally, authorities get to the school before shots are fired, he added.\n“At the very least it provides actionable information for staff and law enforcement to help them react to the situation, including knowing the exact location of the assailant,” Fraser added.\nFor the AI technology to work, the cameras must be able to see the gun – it cannot be concealed.\nMetro Nashville Public Schools approved its two-year contract with Omnilert in March 2023, according to Sean Braisted, a school district spokesperson. Later that month, six people were killed in a shooting at The Covenant School, a private, Christian school in Nashville, about 10 miles from Antioch.\nIn the case of The Covenant School and other similar shootings, “where the armed intruder came from outside of the building or walked the halls with the weapon brandished,” Braisted said Omnilert’s technology “would have been activated and improved police or administrative response.”\nBut, in the Antioch shooting, it appears Henderson’s gun was not brandished – or at least not long enough to trigger an alert from Omnilert. “Based on the shooter’s position and location relative to our cameras, the system was not activated by his weapon,” Braisted told CNN in an email.\nWhile the gun was not visible to surveillance cameras, Fraser stressed, the system did not misidentify the weapon in this case.\n“This is not an issue of malfunction despite the attempts to discredit the functioning of the system or stir up controversy,” he told CNN in an emailed statement. To detect a gun, the camera must be able to “see” the gun, he said, adding the gun was not visible.\nAI gun-detecting technologies like Omnilert have “zero chance of actually preventing a school shooting,” according to Marlow from the ACLU.\n“It fails from a technological standpoint, that it’s very inaccurate in identifying weapons, and it fails in a practical sense, in that even if it worked perfectly, it stands close to zero chance of being able to get someone to intervene before a tragedy occurs, and that’s the big fraud at play here,” Marlow told CNN.\nOmnilert’s CEO called the fraud claims “counterproductive to the mission at hand which is the protection of our most precious resource: the life of our children,” he wrote.\nRelated articlePrivate schools, like in Wisconsin shooting, are responsible for their security. Here’s how they try to protect students\nThe main issue with the technology, Marlow argues, is its inability to work if a gun is not visible to the system’s surveillance cameras. In many cases, shooters conceal weapons with a backpack or a jacket, he added.\n“The only time that that weapon is actually going to be visible to a camera is when the person planning to use it decides to actually take it out of where it’s being concealed from,” Marlow said. “In most cases, that’s going to be done very shortly before it is used.”\nFalse positives are also common, Marlow said, as these types of systems have been known to misidentify broomsticks as rifles, and rulers for knives.\nOmnilert’s CEO maintains the system’s effectiveness, saying, “Like any system, it is not perfect, and has never claimed to be. It’s also not a singular solution to the challenge of gun violence.”\nIf a technology is capable of detecting a gun before it is brought into a school, then it may be an intuitive choice for school districts, according to Marc Zimmerman, codirector of the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention at the University of Michigan. “I mean, why not? Why not use them if they’re not too expensive and they can be applied,” he said.\nUnlike school shooting prevention measures that are backed by data – such as mental health counseling – there is no data that proves the effectiveness of gun detection software in preventing school shootings, as the technology is too new, according to Marlow and Zimmerman. Given the lack of evidence, Zimmerman says school districts should focus on all prevention measures available to them and not just one resource that focuses on keeping a gunman outside of a school.\n“I would argue that if you’re at that point where you’re preventing a gun from coming into school, you’ve already lost. You’ve already lost that child,” Zimmerman added.\nFraser agrees multiple protection methods are needed to properly protect each school. “We always recommend use as part of a layered system which may include human beings, metal detectors and other technologies,” Fraser told CNN in a statement. How those schools are protected is a decision often made by individual school boards and in some cases, parents.\nIn recent years, some school districts have invested in installing emergency windows that allow for an easy exit during a shooting. In Georgia, apanic button systemimplemented less than a week before the September 4 shooting at Apalachee High School helped notify law enforcement officials of the incident almost instantly.\nIn the Nashville area, school district director Adrienne Battle said the district will enhance security measures in response to the shooting in Antioch.\n“As we’ve seen a heightened sense around the safety and security in our schools, both with external (and) internal threats, we are continuing to research and study the most evolving technologies that will help us enhance the safety and security measures within our schools,” Battle said in the aftermath of the shooting.\nSeveral safety measures are in place at Nashville schools in the district, including shatter-resistant film or security vestibules at the entrance of a school to prevent someone from coming inside, according to Braisted, who could not comment on the exact security features at Antioch High School.\nThis week,the school district began installing scannersat the school, similar to metal detectors, which use AI technology and advanced sensors to detect weapons as students walk in, Braisted told CNN in an email Friday.\nBut the developer of the “cutting-edge” system, Evolv Technologies, has been accused of overpromising some of its safety features. It settled a2024 lawsuitwith the Federal Trade Commission accusing the company of using “false claims,” including the system can detect all weapons and is more accurate and efficient than regular metal detectors, the FTC said in anews releaselast year.\nUltimately, parents should also prioritize proper storage of their weapons, Zimmerman added, so their children can’t use them to harm their peers or others.\n“We have to think about this more broadly,” Zimmerman said. “There are multiple things we need to do.”\nCNN’s Rebekah Riess and Dalia Faheid contributed to this report."

            "text": "President Donald Trumpcaught his own administration off guardlast week by suggesting that the nation’s primary disaster response agency might simply “go away.”\nThough Trump had routinely lambasted the Federal Emergency Management Agency throughout his third White House bid, he had stopped short of calling for its elimination. Now, an executive order bearing his signature has put that possibility in motion.\nThe idea, however, wasn’t new. The contours of it circulated nearly two years ago through Project 2025, a sweeping plan to overhaul the government that Trump as a candidate forcefully disavowed.\nMany of Trump’s early actions appear closely aligned with Project 2025’s plans.\nA CNN analysis of the 53 executive orders and actions from Trump’s first week in office found that more than two-thirds – 36 – evoke proposals outlined in “Mandate for Leadership,” Project 2025’s 922-pageblueprintfor the next Republican president. The overlap includes early steps taken by Trump to execute some of his most-touted pledges: cracking down on illegal immigration; dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; and rolling back environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration.\nRelated articleTracking Trump’s executive actions\nBut the framework offered in “Mandate for Leadership” also foreshadowed some of Trump’s more provocative and less expected early actions.\nIt calls for “quickly and aggressively” punishing countries that refuse deported migrants – as Trump did Sunday when Colombia blocked two US military planes carrying deportees. It advises the president to “immediately revoke the security clearance” of top national security officials accused by conservatives of political bias, a move Trump executed within hours of taking office. And Trump’s directive to curb foreign aid from countries “not fully aligned” with his global aims appeases Project 2025’s concern that these programs are “disconnected from the strategy and practice of U.S. foreign policy.”\n“This is exactly the work we set out to do,” Paul Dans, who oversaw Project 2025 at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CNN in an interview Wednesday. “It’s still in the early first stages of bearing fruit, but we wanted to make sure the president was ready to hit the ground running on day one. The rapidity and the depth of what they’ve rolled out this quickly is a testament to the work done in Project 2025 and other presidential transition projects.”\nThe fraction of executive actions that so far do not touch on Project 2025 priorities include some of Trump’s narrower fixations, like declassifying records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, requiring federal workers to return to the office and demanding the flag fly at full staff during presidential inaugurations.\nIn a statement to CNN, the White House picked upwhere Trump’s campaign left off downplaying any connectionbetween the Republican leader and the conservative playbook. The president, his spokesman Harrison Fields said, “had nothing to do with Project 2025.”\n“In his first few days in office, President Trump has delivered on the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people – securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy,” Fields said.\nThe Heritage Foundation declined to comment.\nThink tanks and advocacy organizations from both sides of the aisle typically prepare for incoming administrations with ready-made policy proposals. But Project 2025 was significant for its breadth and coordination across the conservative movement.\nThe Heritage Foundation has found success influencing Republican administrations “through the back channels where a lot of Washington work happens” going back to President Ronald Reagan, said Heath Brown, a City University of New York professor who’s written multiple books on presidential transitions.\nThe organizationonce boastedthat Trump during his first year as president had implemented 64 percent of the 334 policies recommended in the 2016 version of “Mandate for Leadership.” As Trump prepared for a third White House bid, he set the stage for Heritage’s seminal work to inform his next administration’s priorities once again.\n“They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,” Trump said during an April 2022 keynote address to the organizationfirst unearthed by the Washington Post.\nAt least 140 former Trump administration officialsand dozens of ardent allies ultimately wrote and contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.” More than 100 friendly organizations endorsed it.\nBut by mid-2024, with Democrats seizing on Project 2025’s more controversial proposals, Trump furiously sought to distance himself from what would become adeeply unpopularmanifesto.\n“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said in the opening moments  of his September debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. “That’s out there. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it, purposely. I’m not going to read it.”\nSince his November victory, though, Trump has filled key government posts with people who helped put Project 2025 together. Both Tom Homan, who is serving as White House border czar, and Trump’s new CIA Director John Ratcliffe contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.” Brendan Carr, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by Trump, wrote an entire chapter for Project 2025 on the agency he now leads.\nRuss Vought, chosen as director of the Office of Management and Budget, authored a section on presidential power that appeared to preview the freeze on federal spending put in place this week by Trump’s young government.\nThe president, Vought wrote for Project 2025, “should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government. Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”\nDans, who stepped down from his position in July amid intensifying criticism of Project 2025 from Trump, said the first week of Trump’s new term has been “gratifying” to watch. He called the Democratic Party’s “obsession” with Project 2025 – the subject of tens of millions of dollars in negative ads during the presidential race – an “epic electoral fail.”\nDemocrats, though, continue to attack Trump over his ties to the conservative blueprint. Since the election, the Democratic National Committee has sent more than 50 press releases that included the term “Project 2025.”\nSome of the synergy between Trump’s early movements and Project 2025 reflect the expected harmony of a new Republican administration and a supportive right-wing group. Indeed, a considerable share of the manifesto’s voluminous policy plans are anchored in two consistent themes: unravel Joe Biden’s presidency wherever possible and return to the policies of Trump’s first term.\nIn Trump’s first executive order after taking office, he revoked 67 of Biden’s executive orders – including at least 15 singled out in “Mandate for Leadership.”\nMeanwhile, reinstating his first-term border policies – such as blocking federal grants to cities that don’t comply with immigration enforcement – satisfied some of Project 2025’s own immigration prescriptions.\nBut Trump also moved to restrict temporary protected status for those fleeing humanitarian emergencies, paused disbursements to non-profits assisting undocumented immigrants and mobilized the military to assist in border enforcement – all policies pushed by Project 2025.\n“This is not a continuation of the first Trump administration. It is substantially more aggressive, and he’s doing a lot of the things we complained he didn’t do in the first term,” said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump who authored the Project 2025 section on his former agency.\nThe “general aggressiveness is certainly consistent” with what Cuccinelli wrote in Project 2025, he added, pointing especially to the deployment of the military and Trump’s use of Department of Justice officers to assist in deportation.\nAs for FEMA, Cuccinelli in “Mandate for Leadership” urged the new administration to “shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities.” The language is recognizable in the proposal Trump floated recently while touring North Carolina flood damage: “We’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly, we pay a percentage, to the state, and the state should fix it.”\nIn his ensuing executive order, Trump launched a commission to review changes to FEMA, including whether the agency should be reformed to function only as a “support agency” to the states.\nMichael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama and Biden administrations, said that while he had seen the Project 2025 proposal for the agency, it surprised him to hear Trump vocalize it.\n“I never imagined it would be something that he would openly talk about,” Coen said. “It does seem like there are people in the president’s ear that are pushing what is in Project 2025 as far as their plan for FEMA.”\nCuccinelli acknowledged he also hadn’t expected Trump to embrace his proposal on FEMA. In his first term, Trump relished his power awarding emergency relief to disaster-stricken areas.\n“President Trump does love to show up and write checks, but I give him a lot of credit,” Cuccinelli said. “He clearly recognizes that FEMA as a concept is failing.”\nCoen expects Republican governors and local officials will push back against this worldview.\n“States across the country have come to rely on the federal government,” Coen said. “It’s hard to budget for if you’re going to get a 500-year rain event that’s going to wash away a town, and wash away your critical infrastructure.”\nTrump previewed many of his opening movements as president more than a year ago in a series of policy proposals published on a campaign website called “Agenda47,” such as ending subsidies for electric vehicles, limiting refugee programs and restoring a first-term directive allowing him to remove federal workers deemed insufficiently loyal. Those ideas were separately backed by Project 2025’s authors.\nTrump’s campaign website made clear he intended to reopen Alaska to drilling – which he did on his first day as president. Project 2025 endorsed not only the move, but also the urgency.\n“Alaska is a special case and deserves immediate action,” one section said.\nSome of Project 2025’s other priorities have been achieved indirectly through Trump’s actions. For example, a pending plan by the Biden administration for a ground and surface water limit on toxic PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, was withdrawn under Trump’s day one freeze on new regulations.\nA section on the Environmental Protection Agency in “Mandate for Leadership” encouraged the new president to “revisit the designation of PFAS chemicals as ‘hazardous substances.’”\nGroups that had pushed for the Biden administration to crack down on PFAS – known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t degrade in the environment – were well aware of the target placed on those regulations by Project 2025, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of governmental affairs at the Environmental Working Group.\nThere was some reason for optimism, Benesh acknowledged, when Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, touted his past work tackling PFAS during his confirmation hearing. But that hope dissipated when Trump’s executive order effectively stalled Biden’s planned crackdown.\n“It calls into question the incoming administrator’s commitment to taking on PFAS,” Benesh told CNN.\nEPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou  said it was “common transition procedure” to hold pending regulations when a new administration comes in.\n“President Trump advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country in his first term and will continue to do so this term,” Vaseliou said.\nAs the administration moves forward, the extent to which Trump’s actions run parallel to Project 2025 will remain a central question. Some of Trump’s early executive orders appear to lay the groundwork for future actions advocated by Project 2025.\nFor example, Trump’s national energy emergency calls for a review of regulations protecting endangered and marine wildlife that may be “obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure.” Project 2025 suggests the new administration move immediately to lift protections on grizzly bears and gray wolves and work with Congress on an overhaul of the Endangered Species Act.\nElsewhere, Trump has taken steps that seem to go beyond what Project 2025 has proposed. Nowhere in the dozens of pages dedicated to a forceful crackdown on immigration do “Mandate for Leadership” authors suggest declaring the US is under invasion and designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups, as Trump did in his executive orders. Similarly, Trump exceeded Project 2025’s calls to restart federal executions with an executive order expanding the potential crimes that could trigger the death penalty.\nStill, not all of Project 2025’s plans are necessarily included in the public manifesto. The project’swebsiteacknowledged it intended to deliver the Trump transition a “playbook of actions” for the administration’s first 180 days. Neither Heritage nor the Trump White House would say if that exchange took place. And in a hidden-camera video of Voughtreleased last year, he said his group was drafting hundreds of potential orders, regulations and memos for Trump.\n“With immigration in particular, executive orders aren’t necessarily the thing that makes policy change,” said Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group for immigrants. “What’s been notable from the first nine days or so is not just that they had the executive orders ready to go on day one,” but other technical regulations and declarations on hand as well.\n“That kind of timeline indicates a certain amount of preparation before getting into office,” she said.\nDans noted Project 2025 also engaged in a nationwide search for Trump loyalists to fill federal agencies with people who would execute his agenda.\n“It all comes down to implementation,” Dans said, “And Project 2025 was ultimately about putting in place the people who would come in from outside the swamp and make changes.”\nOn at least one issue, Trump is already spurning Project 2025: the future of TikTok. Trump in an executive order paused a ban on the Chinese social media app, which Project 2025 described as a national security imperative.\nTrump also recently said he was “very unlikely” to limit abortion pill access. Project 2025 not only pushes for the administration to reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, it also proposes excluding the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act.\nTrump has, though, moved to restrict federal funding for abortions both domestically and abroad, a stance that also appears in Project 2025’s policy framework. And his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told a Senate hearing Wednesday that Trump asked him to “study the safety” of mifepristone.\nCNN’s review of Trump’s executive actions covered the first week of his new term, from his swearing in until noon on Monday. In the days since, he has remained active, restricting certain treatments for transgender minors, keeping transgender adults out of the military and reinstating servicemembers who were discharged for refusing COVID vaccinations.\nEach of those moves had support in Project 2025.\nEditor’s Note:This story has been corrected to reflect the type of water affected by a withdrawal of new regulations on PFAS."

            "text": "Ken Martin, the head of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, was decisively elected chair of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, beating acrowded fieldin the first round of voting to become the new face of a party struggling to find its footing during the second Trump administration.\nMartin, who has spent 14 years leading the Minnesota party and eight years as a DNC vice chair, emerged as an early front-runner in the race due to his long-standing ties to state party leaders, a key voting bloc. Throughout the campaign, he highlighted his track record: The Minnesota DFL hasn’t lost a single statewide race since he took over the party.\nNow Martin is tasked with a new challenge: strengthening and transforming the national party to withstand the second Trump administration.\n“We’re going to get to work,” Martin said Saturday in his acceptance speech. “We’re going to go out there and take this fight to Donald Trump.”\nlive updatesThe latest on Trump’s presidency as tariff pledge comes due\nThe election of new party leaders comes as Democrats have grappled with the most effective way to challenge the torrent of action spurred by the Trump White House, which just this week included the presidentblaming diversity initiatives for a deadly DC plane collision, afederal funding freezethat was rescinded in less than 48 hours amid widespread backlash, and confirmation hearings forthree controversial Cabinet nominees.\nMartin easily defeated two other leading contenders: Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.\nAll three candidates claimed to have levels of support that, if combined, would have far exceeded 450 – the total number of voting DNC members. Heading into Saturday, Wikler claimed to have 183 endorsements and O’Malley claimed to have 137, though most of those names were private. Martin had released the names of 200 supporters.\nThe final vote showed that only one of the candidates was able to back their numbers up: Martin won with 246.5 votes out of 428 cast. Wikler received 134 votes and O’Malley received 44.\nThe results also showed the limited influence of high-profile endorsements. Wikler gained significant outside support in the final days of the campaign, thanks to endorsements from prominent governors, key labor leaders and top congressional leaders.\n“This is not personal, we’re all on the same team. … I have long-standing relationships in the party, and at the end of the day, I’m really buoyed by that enthusiastic support,” Martin told reporters after the vote. “It was a one-ballot victory for a reason, right?”\nIn addition to choosing the next chair, DNC members will elect seven additional officers: a vice chair for civic engagement and voter participation; a treasurer; a secretary; a national finance chair; and three at-large vice chairs.\nWithout a Democratic president in the White House, leadership of the party will be fractured over the next four years. And with Democrats in the minority in both the House and Senate, much of the focus on Capitol Hill will be aimed at blocking Trump’s agenda rather than advancing the party’s policy priorities.\nMartin will be tasked with helping guide the party forward as it looks to rebound from stinging losses last November. Asked what his message is to Trump, Martin said: The gloves are coming off.\n“I’ve always viewed my roles as a chair of the Democratic Party to take the low road so my candidates and elected officials can take the high road,” Martin said. “So Donald Trump, Republican Party: This is a new DNC. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people.”\nIn addition to fundraising and messaging, Martin will also help steer the 2028 nominating process and create a campaign-in-waiting for the eventual Democratic nominee.\nRelated articleDemocrats grapple with their own message in Trump 2.0\nHe will also need to unite the committee and address several internal issues, including anger over a wave of layoffs last year, demands for increased transparency around budgets and spending, and frustration with campaign consultants.\nOutgoing chair Jaime Harrison touched on some of those tensions at the top of the elections, when he condemned reports that some DNC members had been intimidated, pressured or threatened by donors who said they would withhold funding over their votes.\n“In this party, there will be no tolerance for that type of behavior,” Harrison said. “We must be united because too much is at stake right now in this country.”\nState party leaders, particularly in non-battleground states, had pushed chair candidates to vow to invest more in their states, and rank-and-file members had called for a more democratized process to access exclusive committees made up of appointees.\n“I have never attended a DNC meeting where I left and said, ‘Huh, I learned something,’” Stephanie Campanha Wheaton, one of the Young Democrats of America’s DNC members and a Martin supporter, told CNN. “You show up and you are a pawn, and you nod your head yes to everything that has already been decided upon in committees that you don’t know how people got on.”\nAt the heart of the leadership elections is a desire to make sense of the party’s 2024 losses and chart a path out of political obscurity. In more than a dozen forums, questions have focused on how to win back young men and working-class voters, how to fight disinformation, and how to make better use of the millions for dollars flowing into the party.\n“It’s a sign of a healthy party to actually question each other, debate each other, think about the path forward,” said Tory Gavito, a Wikler backer and the president of Way to Win, a women-led donor coalition that co-hosted a DNC forum with the Texas Democratic Party. “And in this debating, the goal is to win.”\nMartin entered the race first and was an early front-runner thanks to his yearslong relationships with the leaders of various state parties and other DNC members\nJoe Salas, a California DNC member who backed Martin, said he believed the Minnesota chair understands the important role of local committees. On a personal level, he said Martin was the only high-ranking DNC leader to send him a congratulatory card welcoming him to the DNC when he was elected last year.\n“It goes to his point about organizing year-round: You can’t come to somebody a couple of months before an election and ask them to do something,” Salas said. “You have to make deposits before you make withdrawals.”\nWikler experienced a late surge in support fueled by key endorsements from a group of Democratic governors – including DNC voting members Laura Kelly of Kansas, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico – and four large public-sector unions, which issued a joint statement.\nMany of the DNC voters who endorsed Wikler pointed to his track record in Wisconsin since becoming chair in 2019, includingwinning a liberal majorityon the state Supreme Court that paved the way for more competitive legislative maps.\nIn addition to AFT, Wikler was backed by the leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; National Education Association; and Service Employees International Union. Other unions split their support among the leading candidates.\n“We felt like Ben Wikler was the one who could build worker power and expand the party’s base,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, of the joint union endorsement.\nO’Malley, meanwhile, picked up public support from a handful of DNC members and high-profile Democrats such as Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. His critiques of Martin and Wikler became more pointed in the final days of the race.\nThe former governor ribbed Wikler for declining to preemptively release a list of donors to his chair campaign ahead of a Friday night FEC deadline and suggested Martin’s support is not as strong as it seems during a gaggle with reporters after a candidate forum Thursday.\n“When the totally inevitable front-runner, who’s been working at it for five years, shows himself not to be totally inevitable, I think it opens up for a larger debate,” O’Malley said.\nIn the days leading up to the election, the three front-runners released dozens of endorsements from key Democrats, only some of whom are able to vote in the election.\nSoon after Martin announced he’d been backed by South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement helped former President Joe Biden win the 2020 Democratic primary, Wikler announced he had the support of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\nOne key Democrat did not weigh in on who should be chair: former Vice President Kamala Harris. Though the party has spent weeksdebating what went wrongduring her 2024 presidential campaign, Harris did not endorse a candidate in the race.\nHarris spoke on the phone this week with the three leading candidates in the race, a person familiar with the discussions told CNN. In the calls, which each lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, the candidates discussed their visions for the party and expressed their gratitude to Harris for her candidacy and commitment to stay involved with the party’s efforts going forward. The former vice president pledged to work closely with the winning candidate as soon as they’re elected, the source said.\n“In state after state, district after district, from house to house and door to door, you work to energize, organize and mobilize,” Harris said in a video address to the committee after the first round of votes. “And as we continue to fight for our ideals and to realize the promise of America, I will be with you every step of the way.”\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments."

            "category": "politics",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "A few weeks before Donald Trump was sworn in as president, members of his transition team went to the Treasury Department to talk about the handover of power.\nBut what is normally a routine discussion turned into an alarming series of interactions for a handful of top career Treasury officials.\nTrump’s team, which included members of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, peppered Treasury officials about one of the department’s most sensitive and critical functions: processing trillions of dollars in government payments a year.\nThrough a series of specific requests, Trump’s landing team attempted to lift the hood on the department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, an arcane branch that distributes nearly 90 percent of all federal payments, including Social Security benefits, tax refunds and payments to federal workers and contractors. That adds up to a billion annual transactions totaling more than $5 trillion.\nA month later, this obscure Treasury office is now a key battlefront in a wider war being waged by Trump and his allies over federal spending. Signs of the fight emerged this week.\nThe top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, left unexpectedly on Friday after Trump-affiliated officials expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.\nWIth Lebryk out, Musk’s DOGE associates at Treasury now have full access to the government’s payments system.\nAccording to one person familiar with the department, Trump-affiliated employees had previously asked about Treasury’s ability to stop payments. But Lebryk’s pushback was, “We don’t do that,” the person said.\n“They seem to want Treasury to be the chokepoint on payments, and that’s unprecedented,” the person added, emphasizing that it is not the bureau’s role to decide which payments to make — it is “just to make the f-ing payments.”\nBefore Trump’s inauguration, members of his transition landing team wanted to know granular details about the bureau’s proprietary computer systems, including “each step in the disbursement process.” They also wanted to visit field offices where government workers, in Philadelphia or Kansas, work on computers that disburse payments.\nThe requests puzzled many career officials initially. The transition operation hadn’t requested substantive briefings on any of Treasury’s other critical areas of operation, multiple people familiar with the matter said. Veterans of past transition efforts, representing presidents of both parties, couldn’t recall precedent for the Trump team’s entreaty.\nThe arcane process of cutting the government’s checks is normally overlooked by political leadership, though the incoming administration exhibited an odd interest in its inner workings, sources said — raising suspicions among career officials about the intent to tinker with a crucial financial pipeline that keeps the nation’s economy running.\nTension between Lebryk and Trump political appointees, including those affiliated with DOGE, had been mounting, with sources telling CNN that things escalated this week after the Office of Management and Budget on Mondayordereda sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal spending.\nAt the time, Lebryk was the acting Treasury Secretary. Trump’s pick to lead Treasury, Scott Bessent, was sworn in Tuesday. OMBrescindedthat order a few days later after an uproar that’s still being litigated in court.\nLebryk’s departure, which he announced by email to his team on Friday morning, has shaken up career Treasury officials, several sources have told CNN this week. With Lebryk gone, Bessent signed off on access to the payments system for the DOGE team detailed to Treasury by Friday evening.\nDOGE officials, in the lead up to Bessent’s decision to sign-off on their access, had been operating from the position that Trump’s Inauguration Day executive order establishing their agency had already authorized their access. That order, in part, directs the heads of federal agencies to take “all necessary steps” within the law to ensure Musk’s group has “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.”\nLebryk’s exit was first reported by the Washington Post, but the full scale of the tension inside the Treasury Department has not been previously reported. Lebryk didn’t respond to an inquiry from CNN on Friday morning.\nRelated articleInside 45 hours of chaos: The brief life and quick death of Trump’s federal spending freeze\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, called for an investigation on Friday following news of Lebryk’s departure.\n“It’s alarming that Elon Musk is attempting to gain access to the Federal Government’s critical payment system, which is responsible for delivering Social Security checks, tax refunds, and Medicare benefits to Americans across the country,” Warren said in a statement provided to CNN. “It is equally alarming that Musk and the Trump Administration drove out the most senior career official at Treasury as the agency is already taking extraordinary measures to avoid a US default.”\nMultiple Trump administration officials, including people at Treasury, didn’t respond to several requests for comment this week.\nMusk himself acknowledged his interest in the Treasury Department’s payment processing in a middle-of-the-night post on his social media platform Saturday.\nHe wrote his team “discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups.They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.”\nThe post appeared to ignore the mechanisms already in place for Treasury to simply fulfill lawful payment decisions made by other agencies, and that the system’s value to the federal bureaucracy and the nation’s economy lies in its reliability.\nJack Lew, who ran the Treasury Department during President Barack Obama’s second term, said any attempt to disrupt payments made by the BFS would be dangerous to the world’s markets.\n“The American people should not have to worry about political interference when it comes to receiving Social Security and other payments the fiscal service makes,” Lew told CNN. “And as the world’s reserve currency, it is crucial to maintain confidence around the globe that the US Government will make timely payments on its obligations.”\nSome of the members of Trump’s landing team present for the initial transition meetings are now working at the Treasury Department.\nAmong them is Baris Akis, a Musk ally who is the co-founder of a venture capital firm, Human Capital. Akis’ presence raised alarms among some of the Treasury officials present for those early meetings, since he was not an official member of the incoming Trump administration and didn’t have a security clearance at the time, the sources told CNN.\nAkis, along with a few others affiliated with Musk’s DOGE, has been in the Treasury building in recent days. Sources familiar with the department tell CNN they “rove around as a pack” — emphasizing how the group is working in the building in a way that is separate from the rest of the department’s staff.\nAkis did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\nMeanwhile, several blocks away in downtown Washington, Musk has asserted significant influence at the Office of Personnel Management, with at least one other employee formerly with Human Capital. The agency, which serves as the overarching human resources headquarters for the federal government, has historically been an operation driven by career officials who have worked across administrations of both parties.\nPolitical appointees have long played a role, but according to one long-time official, the current iteration “is like a different world.”\nThat world is now populated with a number of Musk acolytes.\nAmanda Scales, who previously worked for Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI after working for Human Capital, arrived at OPM as the agency chief of staff on Inauguration Day and has been the central figure identified with the agency’s sweeping efforts to restructure the federal workforce, multiple agency officials said. She previously worked at Akis’ company.\nBrian Bjelde, the human resources chief for SpaceX, and Anthony Armstrong, a Morgan Stanley banker who worked on Musk’s purchase of Twitter, have also taken on substantial roles. Musk worked out of the OPM headquarters – with his surrogates by his side – last week, the officials said.\nTrump’s nominee to run OPM, Scott Kupor, is awaiting confirmation but also holds deep ties to the Silicon Valley universe integral to Musk’s DOGE operations.\nNonprofits and Democrat-led states are already suing to try to block the Trump administration’s attempts to freeze federal spending. Despite the rescission of the memo directing the pause, they say the lawsuits need to continue, because of evidence the funding is being withheld.\nOn Friday, a federal judge in Rhode Island told the Trump administration it couldn’t block payments to states, nor could it try to revive stopping payments in any agency under Trump. More hearings are to come, including on Monday morning in a separate federal court, in DC.\nThe court fights show how any action by the administration that tampers with congressionally mandated funding could attract aggressive litigation.\nThe lawsuits haven’t yet touched upon the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s work inside the Treasury Department.\nThis story has been updated with new reporting.\nCNN’s  Alayna Treene contributed to this report."

            "text": "Americans don’t know the full extent of what Elon Musk is doing as he embeds alongside President Donald Trump at the top of the federal government.\nWhat we know is that he’s the world’s richest man, the president’s largest campaign benefactor, and a person whose companies have grown fat on government contracts, so he has a greater financial interest in how the government operates than your average naturalized immigrant.\nWith that context in mind, consider this startling passage froma reportby CNN’s Katelyn Polantz, Phil Mattingly and Tierney Sneed about a standoff between career officials at the Treasury Department and employees of DOGE, the Musk-allied Department of Government Efficiency, which has morphed after the election from the out-of-government advisory panel Trump talked about to a rebranded technology unit inside the White House complex. Mattingly, Polantz and Sneed write:\nThe top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, is leaving unexpectedly after Trump-affiliated officials expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n\nAccording to one person familiar with the department, Trump-affiliated employees had asked about Treasury’s ability to stop payments. But Lebryk’s pushback was, “We don’t do that,” the person said.\n\n“They seem to want Treasury to be the chokepoint on payments, and that’s unprecedented,” the person added, emphasizing that it is not the bureau’s role to decide which payments to make — it is “just to make the f-ing payments.”\n\n“This is the critical battle to restore power to the PEOPLE from the massive unelected bureaucracy!” he wrote on the social media platform he owns, pushing people to rally at events opposing the use of taxpayer dollars to fund NGOs, nonprofits unaffiliated with the government that are supposed to do good works.\nThinkCatholic Relief Services, theWorld Food ProgramandSave the Children. There can be a legitimate debate about whether the US should fund those programs in part because we know, thanks to transparency, that the US government is funding those programs.\nBut his method of taking over the bureaucracy is much less transparent than the bureaucracy itself.\nWhen Bill Clintonoffered buyouts to federal workers, in 1993, for instance, he did so after getting buy-in from Congress. Trump’s administration is banking on a slim majority of Republicans in the House buying in to his plan, assuming they get a chance to have a say.\nThe New York Times and othersreported this weekthat three former Musk employees have taken top positions at the Office of Personnel Management, the formerly obscure HR department for the federal government. It was OPM that first created a government-wide email system and then blasted it with an offer to millions of federal workers giving them the option to resign with pay until September. The offer caught federal workers off guard and unions and government watchdogs have said it is illegal.\nRelated articleElon Musk spent more than $290 million on the 2024 election, year-end FEC filings show\nOPM confirmed to me that Amanda Scales, who used to work for Musk’s AI company xAI, is now chief of staff at OPM. Brian Bjelde, whose Linkedin profile still lists him as a SpaceX employee, is now a senior director, and so is Anthony Armstrong, a banker who worked with Musk to take over Twitter.\nThe New York Times report included other Musk allies in positions at other agencies, including the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate. Despite encouraging workers to return to the office, Musk also sees getting rid of government real estate or leases, and dispersing remaining workers throughout the country, as a cost saving technique.\nTrump has twice referred to federal workers being fired if they’re not in offices after a February 6 deadline. “If they don’t agree by February 6 to show up back to work in their office, they will be terminated,” he said during a speech at the White House this week. There’s nothing in the resignation offer about people actively being fired in the near term.\nWiredreported he’s told friends he is sleeping at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds. CNN has not confirmed the report, although it is similar to the story he told about his early days at Twitter and Tesla, when he proved his devotion to employees by sleeping at the office or on the factory floor. It’s either the ultimate commitment to working from home or the ultimate commitment to his job.\nOne outstanding question: Has he taken an oath, like the federal workers he apparently has plans to fire, to uphold the Constitution?\nI asked Walter Shaub, the former Director of the Office of Government Ethics, who has raised warnings about Trump but also criticized Democrats, about the opacity of Musk’s role and why it should concern Americans.\n“The Trump administration owes the American people a detailed explanation as to precisely how it hopes to manage conflicts of interest, as well as whether it deems Musk and each of the other participants in DOGE as a volunteer, a special government employee or a regular government employee,” he said in an email.\nThat’s why Trump’s nominees to lead agencies have to undergo nomination hearings on Capitol Hill and why top officials are supposed to file paperwork with theOffice of Government Ethicsdisclosing their financial interests and pledging to act ethically.\nThey’re supposed to know how their government is spending money and who is doing the spending. The mass resignation offer that caught everyone off guard was made under authority granted to the OPM director. Trump’s nominee, the venture capitalist Scott Kupor, has not yet been confirmed, so the agency is operating with an acting director.\nMusklaid out some ideas in the Wall Street Journal, back in November when he was working with Vivek Ramaswamy, who has left DOGE.\nMass firings?That plan presaged an effort to encourage workers to resign. What comes next, according to that Journal plan, is they will “identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions,” after which Trump could suspend worker protections to enforce a “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” One wonders how many air traffic controllers is the minimum number required.\nSteep spending cuts?They’re hoping to grab new power, with help from the Supreme Court, for the president to simply ignore Congress and not spend money, something called impoundment. They also wanted to cut $500 billion in spending by targeting things like public broadcasting and foreign aid. There’s already evidence of this plan in Trump’s since-rescinded order to halt federal grants.\nA hard look at Medicare?Some of the efforts should be welcome to Americans, like a long overdue examination of federal contracting and procurement. But don’t be surprised when it takes a hard look at Medicare spending, despite Trump’s pledge not to cut safety net spending. It’sall written outin the Journal.\nWhat’s not written is a public plan or a list of Musk allies now in the government. That is something everyone should want to take a look at."

            "text": "In the wake of theworst American air disaster in two decades, the understaffed and cash-strapped National Transportation Safety Board was scrambling to keep investigators from leaving after federal employees received an offer by the Trump administration to resign and be paid through September.\nAn internal NTSB memo informed employees Friday that they would not be eligible for the program.\nNTSB, an independent and apolitical agency that does not report to the executive branch, investigates transportation accidents, provides aid to those affected by them and recommends safety measures. Multiple sources confirmed to CNN that all 400 of its staffers received the email titled “Fork in the Road” —effectively offering a buyoutfrom the federal government.\nThat message, dated 9:41 p.m. ET Tuesday, went out barely 23 hours before an American Airlines regional jet operated by PSA Airlines and a US Army Blackhawk helicoptercollided in a tremendous fireball, plunging all67 on boardthe two aircraft into the icy Potomac River below. There were no survivors.\nThe disaster apparently left top brass at the agency scrambling behind the scenes to find a way to exempt employees from the Trump administration’s offer. Friday, the head of the NTSB sent a message to any employee who agreed to administration’s initial message to “rescind their deferred resignation letter immediately” with the Office of Personnel Management.\nOne source said the initial message came as a shock to staffers, including highly specialized investigators, many of whom are nearing retirement. “It’s not like we have an easy time finding people,” the source said.\nAnother source told CNN they know investigators who were seriously considering accepting the offer.\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy — who serves as the agency’s chief executive officer — sent an agencywide email Friday saying the agency was “granted a full exemption” to the deferred resignation program. The move “means this program is not available to NTSB employees.”\n“Given the nature of our safety work, limited budget, and the ongoing investigation of the highest fatality, mass casualty aviation accident since 9/11,” said the email message viewed by CNN, “we need each and every position represented at our agency in order for us to successfully carry out our mission critical work.”\nThis story and headline have been updated."

            "text": "Multiple US government agencies have ordered employees “to remove gender identifying pronouns from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM” on Friday, according to internal emails seen by CNN.\nDirectives were sent out to employees at agencies including the State Department, Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The emails said the move was to align withPresident Donald Trump’s“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth” executive order, which says it is US government policy “to recognize two sexes, male and female.” That executive order does not make any specific mention of pronouns, which commonly include “she” and “he” to refer to a woman and a man, respectively, and “they” as a gender-neutral descriptor.\nAlong with the directive addressing pronouns, several agencies rolled out other changes Friday, ranging from website updates to curtailing celebrations related to diversity. These moves come as Trump is carrying out his campaign pledge of gutting federal diversity and inclusion programs and policies. Within days of taking office, the Trump administration orderedemployees in federal DEIand accessibility offices to be placed on paid administrative leave and instructed federal agencies to move to terminate such offices within 60 days. Trump has also ended the use of DEI criteria in hiring and federal contracting.\nOne State Department employee said there is a sense of fear about what Friday’s directive signals for freedom of speech and expression at the agency.\nAn email from the State Department’s acting head of management noted that the agency “is reviewing all agency programs, contracts, and grants that inculcate gender ideology, and we are removing outward facing media that does the same.”\nThe email added that offices in the State Department “have already been alerted to review trainings, forms, and plans that involve gender ideology.”\nThe ODNI workforce also received a memo earlier this week notifying employees of allegations that some intelligence officers were attempting to “subvert” presidential directives to “terminate” DEI programs across the government and warning that all such reports would be referred to the inspector general for immediate investigation.\nThe memo says those allegations, if verified by the intelligence community inspector general, could result in “possible disciplinary action, including termination,” according to a copy reviewed by CNN.\n“It is my understanding that these alleged actions go beyond unintentional missteps, which can happen when implementing a quick pivot to new priorities and cause harm to the reputation of our Community,” the memo adds.\nIn a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for ODNI said, “The staff notification you’re referencing reflects that ODNI has established a channel for officers to report information, including classified information, for further evaluation in accordance with (Office of Personnel Management)’s message to the federal workforce regarding DEIA.”\nSome of the other recently implemented changes include:\nEmployees at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also received a similar directive that targets contracts with DEI provisions, and employees were told that it is in accordance with Trump’s executive order on gender identity, according to a memo seen by CNN.\nHHS was tasked with identifying all contracts that include the terms “he/she/they/them,” all combined, along with “inclusivity” and variations of “nonbinary” by Friday so that they can be terminated.\nAt least two agencies have also updated sections of their website that relate to LGBTQ people.\nThe State Department has removed references to transgender, queer and intersex people in its pages that provide information for international travel. With the change from “LGBTQI+” to “LGB,” the pages solelyinclude references to different sexualities and not gender identities.\nA section of the department’s website forLGBTQ parents looking to adoptinternationally was changed Friday, according to a published time stamp, and no longer makes reference to the full acronym. The page that provides broader information for“travelers with special considerations”also shows it had been updated last week.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Fridayalso removed websites and datasets related to LGBTQ people.\nAlso on Friday, the Department of Defense announced that it will not host events for “cultural awareness months,” mere hours before the start of Black History Month.\nThe department said in a statement that “identity months” are now “dead” at the Pentagon, adding that “official resources,” which include employees’ time, will not be dedicated to celebrations of months that recognize diversity. The statement also informs employees that if they choose to attend such events, it must be “in an unofficial capacity outside of duty hours.”\n“Installations, units, and offices are encouraged to celebrate the valor and success of military heroes of all races, genders, and backgrounds as we restore our warrior culture and ethos,” the statement said. “We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics.”\nThe department points to the following months in its statement: Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month and National American Indian Heritage Month.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nCNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed reporting."

            "category": "politics",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "US Secretary of StateMarco Rubioarrives in Panama on Saturday for his first trip as the United States’ top diplomat that will test if his diplomacy can build on President Donald Trump’s bellicose and transactional approach to “American First” foreign policy, particularly on migration.\nRubio’s choice to visit Central America – Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic – is intentional and meant to drive forward the Trump agenda by “paying closer attention to our own neighborhood.”\nMigration will be a key focus throughout Rubio’s trip, set against the backdrop of the dramatic confrontation between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro last Sunday.\nDiscussion about thePanama Canal– which Trump has repeatedly said should be back under US control – is also “a priority” while the top US diplomat is in Panama City.\nRubio is also expected to emphasize efforts to counter China in the region. However, aid officials and some US officials say this effort – and priorities like countering illegal migration and drug trafficking – have been undermined by his sweeping foreign assistance freeze.\nOn migration, Trump officials have been mapping out a Latin America strategy, keenly aware that the region is integral to their aggressive deportation agenda. For years, the US has been sending back migrants from Central American countries. However, the Covid-19 pandemic in part spurred record migration across the Western Hemisphere, meaning that more people were journeying to the United States’ southern border from multiple countries.\nThe less-than-day-long public showdown between the Trump and Petro has been a key talking point among Trump officials and offers a window into how the administration plans to approach its dealings with regional allies.\n“We need to work with countries of origin to halt and deter further migrant flows, and to accept the return of their citizens present in the U.S. illegally,” Rubio wrote in the Wall Street Journal Friday.\n“Some countries are cooperating with us enthusiastically—others, less so. The former will be rewarded,” he said. “For the latter, Mr. Trump has already shown that he is more than willing to use America’s considerable leverage to protect our interests. Just ask Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro.”\nStill, how the administration plans to specifically work with its partners in the Western Hemisphere is still unclear.\nOne test will be how the Trump administration leverages its close relationship with El Salvador. US officials are in talks with the country to strike an asylum agreement that would allow the US to send asylum seekers who are not Salvadoran to El Salvador to seek protections.\nThe matter is expected to be discussed during Rubio’s meetings with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele and other officials.\n“During the first Trump Administration, El Salvador was one of three countries that had a Safe Third Agreement with the United States, which will also be a topic of discussion,” Trump special envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone told reporters Friday.\nThe US and El Salvador also expected to discuss the possibility of deporting suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in Venezuela, to El Salvador, where Bukele’s vast and violent crackdown on gangs has earned admiration from the Trump administration.\n“Those extraordinary measures, which are frankly the envy of a lot of countries throughout the Western Hemisphere, has really made him one of the most consequential leaders not only on security but a great ally on migration,” Claver-Carone said.\n“We’re looking to do a new agreement that might include the members of the Tren de Aragua, who will want to go back to Venezuela rather than having to share the prison with the Salvadorean gangs like MS-13. It’s part of what we want to discuss and how President Bukele can help us,” Claver-Carone said.\nIn Costa Rica too, Rubio will seek to expand repatriation efforts.\n“One of the subjects of discussion will be a repatriation program with Costa Rica to help with not only those that are coming up from South America but those that are coming from throughout the world, extra-continentals that are coming through and how they can help repatriate in that manner,” Claver-Carone said.\nPanama is also critical to efforts to reducing migrant traffic. The country is home to the Darien Gap, a treacherous jungle connecting South and Central America. Crossings there have served as a barometer of how many migrants may be journeying to the US southern border. The number of people trekking through the passage has plummeted.\nThe number of migrants who have crossed Panama in the first 23 days of January 2025 has decreased by 93% compared to the same period in the previous year, according to the National Migration Service of Panama.\nThe US and Panama struck an agreement last year under former President Joe Biden to address the flow of migrants coming through the Darien Gap that included equipment, transportation, and logistic support. The passage, which remains a priority for the Trump administration, is expected to come up in meetings between Rubio and Panamanian officials, including President José Raúl Mulino.\n“We have a very successful repatriation program with Panama that frankly should be expanded, and obviously that’ll be a focus on the conversation,” Claver-Carone said Friday.\nThe issue of the Panama Canal is “a priority to be discussed,” he said. Rubio will tour the canal and “visit with the Panama Canal administrator.”\nTrump’s repeated, publicly stated desire for the US to retake control of the key waterway has already caused a diplomatic stir, with Mulino repeatedly stating that that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal is not up for debate.\n“There is no discussion on this issue. The soul of a country is not up for discussion,” Mulino emphasized on Thursday, just days ahead of his scheduled meeting with Rubio.\nOfficials, including Rubio, have argued it is a matter of national security and deterring Beijing becausePanama Ports– part of a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings – operates terminals on the Atlantic and Pacific sides of the canal.\n“It’s a technicality, but in reality, if China wanted to obstruct traffic in the Panama Canal, they could,” Rubio said in an interview with Megyn Kelly Thursday.\n“We cannot allow any foreign power – particularly China – to hold that kind of potential control over it that they do. That just can’t continue,” he said.\nThe issue of countering China is expected to come up across his regional visits. Trade between China and Latin American countries has ballooned from $10 billion in 2000 to $450 billion in 2022, according to the Americas Society/Council of the Americas.\n“We look forward to expanding with Guatemala the discussions on how to continue to support us on migration, and obviously countering Chinese influence throughout the region,” Claver-Carone said. Guatemala has maintained diplomatic ties with Taiwan even as other countries like El Salvador have not.\nHumanitarian officials and some US officials argue that the US is ceding influence to China in South and Central America because of Trump’s policies like the foreign aid freeze, which they say creates a vacuum that Beijing will be happy to fill.\nThere are scores of programs in the region caught up in the sudden and sweeping pause on foreign assistance. Those programs include efforts to counter narcotics, something that is said to be a priority when Rubio visits the Dominican Republic.\nCNN has asked the State Department if any waivers have been issued for programs in the region ahead of Rubio’s visit.\nCNN’ Angelica Franganillo Díaz, Stefano Pozzebon and Patrick Oppmann contributed reporting."

            "text": "Elon Musk spent a total of more than $290 million on the 2024 election, new federal filings show, boosting President Donald Trump and Republicans in a staggering effort that has helped to secure unprecedented access for the world’s richest person in the new administration.\nThe year-end filings, covering the final five weeks of the year, also revealed jockeying for influence as the new administration prepared to take power. Trump’s old campaign committee — converted into a new account he can use to flex his political muscle, despite being term-limited — hauled in nearly $21 million in the period. Meanwhile, a top allied super PAC received several million-dollar contributions, including $1 million from the administration’s nominee for ambassador to the UK, onthe dayhe was tapped to serve.\nIn addition, the filings showed how the parties and some of their key members are getting set for the 2026 midterm election cycle, with potentially vulnerable incumbents in battleground states like Georgia, North Carolina, and New Hampshire stockpiling cash. And the Democratic National Committee spent heavily in the weeks following the party’s losses in 2024, dropping more than $56 million settling headquarters expenses, paying legal fees, and soliciting its voters feedback and funds.\nThe new filings with the Federal Election Commission on Friday showed that Musk put about $11.2 million into his main super PAC, America PAC, on the final day of the year — which brought his total political giving for the cycle to more than $290 million, a massive sum rivaled by only a handful of competing mega donors.\nMusk’s end-of-the-year contributions were earmarked for “petition incentives,” related to the million-dollar giveaways that he organized through the super PAC in the home stretch of the race. Those giveaways — aimed at encouraging voter registration — drew legal challenges, though they were ultimatelyallowed to continue.\nRelated articleWe do not know what exactly Elon Musk is doing to the federal government\nThe latest filing from Musk’s super PAC shows that the giveaways cost him a total of more than $50 million, out of the more than $290 million that he spent on the 2024 election.\nMusk’s donations in 2024 were mostly aimed at supporting Trump; about a quarter of a billion dollars that he gave went to America PAC, the main super PAC that Muskformedfor the election. But Musk also gave millions to several other super PACs and outside groups that supported a range of GOP candidates, and he cut $10,000 checks to dozens of state Republican Party committees.\nNow ensconcedin the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE),” a new agency that he helped form, Musk is poised to reap a return on his unprecedented political investment and is already at work reshaping the federal government. Furthermore, he’sindicated plansfor his super PAC to “keep grinding” in the 2026 midterms.\nPolitical committees affiliated with President Trump raked in millions in the final weeks of 2024 — funds that the term-limited president can use to flex his political muscle, even if not for his own campaigns.\nAfter the election, Trump converted his 2024 campaign account into a leadership PAC, a type of committee with which he can continue to raise and spend funds for political purposes. The committee, now called Never Surrender, reported nearly $21 million in total receipts during the final five weeks of the year.\nNever Surrender had about $27.4 million in cash on hand entering 2025, but with a complicated set of books — the committee reported that it had debts of more than $11 million, nearly all to a telemarketing firm, and also that it was owed nearly $4.7 million, including $4.67 million from the US Secret Service and several thousand dollars from the New York Times and ABC, for air travel.\nMeanwhile, MAGA Inc., a leading pro-Trump PAC, raised $18.3 million in the year-end period, receiving seven-figure contributions from a series of prominent donors, including the financier Warren Stephens, who gave $1 million to the group on December 2, the same day he was tapped to be the next ambassador to the UK; Anthony Pratt, an Australian billionaire, who gave $4 million; and Alexander Karp, CEO of Palantir — a company with several ties to Musk — who also gave $1 million.\nIn sum, the filings show that millions continued to flow to Trump and his allies in the wake of his electoral victory, positioning his political operation to continue shaping Republican politics into the new administration.\nGeorgia, North Carolina and New Hampshire are host to a trio of Senate incumbents seeking reelection in 2026, and year-end FEC reports showed how those members were set up entering the critical cycle.\nIn Georgia, Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff had a strong fundraising period to close the year, raising $2.2 million and reporting nearly $5 million in the bank at the end of 2024. Ossoff is among the most endangered incumbents on the ballot in 2026, seeking a second term in a state that has swung between the parties through a series of fiercely contested statewide elections over the last decade.\nIn another top battleground, North Carolina, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis raised just over $900,000 during the reporting period and had about $2.2 million in cash on hand entering 2025. Funds will be crucial for Tillis, who is hoping to ward off a conservative primary challenge as he faces pressure to support the Trump agenda, while still positioning himself for crossover appeal in the highly competitive state.\nFinally, in New Hampshire, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen reported raising about $170,000 and had about $1.5 million banked at the end of the year, as she too preps for what could be a tough race in a state that just elected GOP Gov. Kelly Ayotte by nearly 10 points in 2024, even as Trump fell short there by less than 3 points.\nIn addition, the round of year-end filings showed the party committees rebuilding for the next election cycle. The Republican National Committee reported raising about $14.6 million, spending about $19.3 million, and entering 2025 with about $38 million in the bank.\nOn the other hand, the Democratic National Committee raised a brisk $31.5 million, but spent heavily, about $56.6 million, with millions going to accounts related to headquarters expenses — including a $5.7 million reimbursement to the Harris campaign for headquarters expenses — and millions more going to legal fees, payroll, and voter outreach. The DNC reported that it had about $22.1 million in cash on hand at the end of the year."

            "text": "President Donald Trump’s allies, including Vice President JD Vance, are making calls to shore up support for both Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard following their confirmation hearings this week, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\nKennedy, Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and Gabbard, his pick to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,both faced sharp questionsfrom Democrats — and several Republicans — this week in what amounted to the most direct skepticism from GOP senators over Trump’s nominees to date.\nlive updatesThe latest on Trump’s presidency as tariff pledge comes due\nPeople close to Trump and those helping to confirm his nominees are most concerned about Gabbard’s confirmation chances, specifically after the former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaiirefused to say whethershe believed the actions of Edward Snowden were traitorous to the US. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, in 2013 revealed the existence of the bulk collection of American phone records by the NSA before fleeing to Russia.\nIn 2021, during Trump’s first term, he considered granting Snowden a pardon but later said he decided to “let that one ride, let the courts work it out.” Trump is not currently considering a pardon for Snowden, one White House official told CNN.\nGabbard has also drawn scrutiny from Senate Intelligence Committee lawmakers over herviews on surveillanceand a series of controversial meetings she held in Lebanon and Syria in 2017, including with then-President Bashar al-Assad.\nOne White House official told CNN that while they are working to assuage concerns regarding Gabbard, they have had “encouraging conversations” with lawmakers, adding that Gabbard met privately with senators following her hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The official said Gabbard clarified her position on Snowden and her broader views regarding the United States’ use of surveillance during the meetings. One White House official believes she’s helped assuage some concerns in those private sessions.\nGabbard huddled with Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, after the hearing, and their teams have been in regular contact to address concerns and to shore up support, according to a source familiar. Gabbard also called a Republican member of the committee to touch base.\nGabbard has plans to meet with Republican senators on the Hill next week, including those not on the committee. Some Democrats have reached out to Gabbard, and she intends to meet with those who’ve asked for a meeting, the source said.\nRelated articleFact check: RFK Jr. denied saying things he did say\nKennedy, meanwhile, facedbipartisan grillingduring two days of Senate confirmation hearings as he attempted to downplay his history of anti-vaccine rhetoric and win over senators wary of his controversial stances.\nIn a warning sign for Kennedy, he faced some of the most direct skepticism from GOP senators during the hearings for Trump’s nominees. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who practiced medicine for 30 years, acknowledged that Kennedy is now trying to downplay his anti-vaccine rhetoric despite anextensive, recorded historyof his linking vaccines to autism in children.\n“It’s no secret, I have some reservations about your past positions on vaccines and a couple other issues,” Cassidy said. “Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me. Can I trust that that is now in the past?”\nIf all Democrats oppose Trump’s nominees, they can afford to lose only three GOP senators on the floor to win confirmation. But Gabbard’s nomination could be in danger of not making it that far — as it would take only one Republican to block her nomination in the Senate Intelligence Committee if all Democrats on the panel oppose her.\nTrump’s allies mounted a significant pressure campaign against on-the-fence Republicans to get Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s confirmationover the finish line, and similar campaigns have been promised toward GOP senators if they oppose other Trump nominees, such as Gabbard or Kennedy."

            "text": "President Donald Trump’s offer to most federal employees toresign nowand be paid through September stunned the workers who received it – angering some, confusing many and raising questions about whether the offer is even legal.\nWhen a US Department of Agriculture staffer based in Mississippi received the deferred resignation offer on Tuesday, they read through it, laughing because it was just “nonsensical,” and then deleted it.\n“I’ve got my whole entire life invested in the federal government,” said the staffer, who also spent time in the military. “I’m not going to throw everything away.”\nAcross the United States, multiple federal workers who spoke with CNN said they weren’t willing to sacrifice benefits beyond their salaries – including health and retirement benefits and student loan forgiveness – not to mention careers. They requested their names not be used for fear of retaliation.\nFederal workers’ unions quickly lashed out at the deferred resignation offer, stressing that it was not a buyout and that the administration might not be able to follow through on it.\n“Employees should not take the Program at face value,” the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workforce union, told members about the offer inan FAQon Wednesday. The communications from the Office of Personnel Management are “riddled with inconsistencies and uncertainties. It is also unclear whether OPM has the legal authority to support the Program or its alleged benefits, and the eligibility criteria are vague.”\nThe union warned that the offer contains no guarantees that employees whose resignations are accepted “will receive the benefits that the Program purports to offer.” And it noted that the federal government is only funded through mid-March, so the Trump administration cannot make payment promises beyond then until Congress passes a spending bill.\nThe backlash prompted the Trump administration to send another email to employees on Friday, this time coming from their individual agencies. It reinforced, in underlined text, that the offer is “valid, lawful, and will be honored by” the respective departments. Also, those who accept the offer will “not be subject to a reduction-in-force or other premature separation,” will not be expected to work during the roughly eight-month period (with rare exceptions) and can take a non-governmental job during that time.\nTrump’s deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said, without evidence, that “a significant number of federal workers have accepted the buyout offer” during a gaggle with reporters at the White House Friday.\nBut workers CNN interviewed are not jumping at the chance to jump ship.\nThe Mississippi USDA employee, who said accepting the offer is out of the question, was most offended that the OPM email referenced that federal employees should be “loyal.”\n“When I raised my right hand way back a long time ago, I swore to defend the Constitution,” they told CNN. “So I’m not loyal to anybody. I’m loyal to my country.”\nThe OPM email, which contained the subject line “Fork in the Road,” had many similarities to an email that X, then called Twitter,sent to its employeesdays after Elon Musk took over the company. Musk now leads Trump’sDepartment of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with shrinking the federal workforce as one of its mandates.\nThe offer came as Trump seeks to reshape the federal workforce – including reducing its size, replacing career workers with political appointees,wiping away some civil service protections,ending diversity effortsand more.\nSome2.4 million peoplework for the federal government, not including postal workers, who are not eligible for the package. Also excluded are military personnel and those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security, among others.\nThose who qualify have to decide by February 6.\nA US Department of Agriculture employee, who is nearing retirement, said they won’t take Trump up on the incentive and don’t expect anyone else in their field office in Illinois to, either.\n“They’re trying to change everything overnight,” said the employee. “They’re trying to reinvent the government, and I don’t think they can do it.”\n“I retire by 60. I have my 25 years. I’m vested. I’m not going anywhere,” they continued.\nTrump’s administration is also seeking to crack down on federal employeesworking from home or in hybrid roles, rather than in their offices full-time.\nBut much of the federal workforce is located outside the nation’s capital, and Trump’s offer was met with confusion and skepticism in many of those offices. While some workers said it was unclear from the original email if they’d have to continue working through September,an FAQon the OPM site said that employees would not be expected to work and were encouraged to find private sector jobs.\n“You are most welcome (to) stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination. Whatever you would like,” the FAQ read.\nOthers didn’t like the ominous warning in the OPM email that if they opt to stay, “we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.” They also bristled at the OPM FAQ that encourages workers to move from “lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector” to boost American prosperity.\nA Labor Department employee told CNN they initially considered the offer, but said, “as time passes, more skepticism grows,” in part because of their doubts that the Trump administration will follow through on the eight months of pay it offered.\nOneDepartment of Veterans Affairs worker said the Trump administration’s offer had backfired.\n“Before today, I heard nothing except folks wanting to leave,” the worker said a day after receiving the offer. “Today folks are determined to stay.”\nThe initial offer to quit raised eyebrows among some who said the emails they’ve received lately from the OPM did not look legitimate. Some thought the initial test emails OPM sent last week were phishing scams, prompting them to ask their managers what to do.\nSome federal workers said Trump’s changes will uproot their lives – and said the offer diminishes the value of work they believe helps Americans.\nOne Internal Revenue Service worker told CNN that the offer angered them, although a few of their colleagues have expressed interest in it.\n“Do they think we’re stupid enough to do it?” said the staffer, who intends to stay with the federal government until retirement, which is still years away. “They are going to have to fire me.”\nThe worker, who lives in the South with their spouse and young child, said they find it fulfilling to help people.\n“I really do love it, especially when I’m on the phone with someone getting their problems sorted out and [the taxpayer is] having money coming their way that they’ve been desperately trying to get ahold of on their own,” the IRS staffer said.\nSome workers found the OPM email disturbing. One Department of Interior employee – who said their division is already understaffed and has had to hire contractors, who are paid more – couldn’t sleep on Tuesday night after receiving the deferred resignation package.\n“It’s intimidation. It’s harassment,” said the worker, who lives in Oklahoma. “It’s questioning all the hard work and importance of what we do. Being treated like this is not humane, and it’s not professional.”\nThe OPM email was written in a manner designed to coerce federal employees to resign, Doreen Greenwald, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CNN in an interview.\n“It was written in a very negative tone, in a threatening manner,” she said. “It provided no clarity on what was being offered.”\nAfter OPM announced the offer, the union sent an urgent notice to members “strongly” urging them not to resign. The NTEU wanted to reassure employees that they had a choice, Greenwald said.\n“There were no answers provided in that document, and so we had to provide that information to our members to protect them,” she told CNN.\nPlus, having a mass exodus of federal employees “would be catastrophic to the federal government and the services that Americans depend on every day,” Greenwald said.\nOther federal employee unions had similar messages for their members, all questioning the legality of the offer.\n“Unlike structured programs that the federal government offered in the past to decrease the number of federal employees, this maneuver is intended to panic civil servants into accepting what seems like a sweet deal but is probably a scam,” Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, said in a statement Wednesday.\n“The offer is a scare tactic designed to pressure federal workers into quitting while promising under an illegal and unenforceable agreement to pay them until October.”"

            "text": "The Trump administration is preparing to revoke legal status for many migrants who entered the United States under a Biden-era program, according to a source familiar with the planning, expanding the pool of people who could be deported.\nThe move is expected to affect migrants from Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela, and Haiti who arrived during President Joe Biden’s term under a humanitarian parole program and were allowed to temporarily live and work in the US. More than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans arrived to the US under the program.\nSome are eligible for other programs that could protect them from deportation. But if they have not pursued other legal avenues to remain in the US, they may be eligible for removal, according to the source.\nRelated articleHow Trump calling immigration an ‘invasion’ could help him stretch the law\nIt’s the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to strip temporary protections for migrants already residing in the United States.\nRepublicans slammed Biden’s use of the humanitarian parole program, arguing that his administration exceeded its authority in its use of the program. In his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for a review of parole.\nBiden administration officials argued the so-called humanitarian parole authority helped drive down illegal border crossings by giving people a legal pathway to the country. The program required that migrants have a sponsor in the US, undergo screening and vetting, and complete vaccinations.\nThe proposal, first reported by CBS News, is still being finalized.\nMany of those who arrived under the humanitarian parole program have been in the US for less than two years. Trump officials expanded a procedure to speed up deportations to include undocumented immigrants anywhere in the US who cannot prove they’ve lived in the country continuously for two years or more.\nThe fast-track deportation procedure, known as “expedited removal,” allows immigration authorities to remove an individual without a hearing before an immigration judge. Migrants stripped of parole may be eligible for speedy deportation."

            "tags": "",
            "text": "President Donald Trump announced extraordinary new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China — signing the long-promised economic policy at his Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday. The Trump administration said tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants into America, but they potentially risk substantial price increases for American consumers across a wide array of common goods from avocados to sneakers to cars.\nThe new policy represents a reversal of virtually duty-free trade among the three North American nations that’s existed for several years — and an expansion of a frosty trade war between China and the United States that has escalated over the course of the past two administrations.\nAs Trump has repeatedly promised over the past several months, the tariffs will amount to a significant 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States. The tariffs will have no exemptions, and the executive action Trump signed Saturday will close the so-calledde minimisloophole that had allowed shipments of $800 or less to come into the United States tax-free – a key provision used by many American small businesses but also Chinese companies like Shein and Temu. Trump administration officials said the loophole prevented customers officials from properly inspecting those packages.\nAlthough Trump administration officials said Saturday the tariffs were designed to stop the flow of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants, they gave no specific benchmark for the new import taxes to be lifted — other than the cessation of the drugs and undocumented immigrants coming into the country.\nThe tariffs are expected to invite retaliation, perhaps igniting a trade war that could significantly damage the economies of the targeted countries and the United States. In anticipation of that, Trump’s executive action includes a clause that allows the president to expand the tariffs if a country imposes new tariffs on the United States.\nNotably, the tariffs included an important carve-out — the tariff on Canadian energy products will be 10%. Many Americans rely on Canadian energy products, including oil, electricity, natural gas, for fuel and home heating. The cost of those items could rise when the tariffs are put in place.\nTo put the tariffs in place, Trump in his executive action declared a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as “IEEPA,” which unilaterally authorizes a president to manage imports during a national emergency. The tariffs are set to go into effect on Tuesday morning at 12:01 am ET.\n“Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China,” Trump said in a messagepostedto Truth Social on Saturday. “This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl. We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all.”\nThe tariffs  could lead to potentially much higher costs, disrupted supply chains and the loss of jobs. In a call with reporters Saturday, a Trump administration official said any retaliation from Mexico, China or Canada would likely result in even higher tariffs for that country. Even Trump acknowledged the potential for adverse consequences on American consumers.\n“There could be some temporary, short-term disruption, and people will understand that,” Trump said Friday when pressed by reporters on the cost of tariffs being passed on to importers, and, by extension, consumers. “But the tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong — and we’re going to treat other countries very fairly.”\nRelated live-storyTrump announces new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in anticipation of Trump’s actions, has said previously that Canada wouldretaliateforcefully and swiftly if the United States imposed tariffs. The country’s trade representatives met with Trump administration officials as recently as Friday in an attempt to stave off the tariffs.\nJonathan Wilkinson, Canada’s natural resources minister, said in aposton X that Canada did “nothing to provoke tariffs” from the United States but is “prepared and ready to fight” for its residents. Tim Houston, premier of Nova Scotia, announced his small Canadian province will take all US alcohol off the shelves Tuesday when the tariffs go into effect. Ontario, a much larger province, has threatened to do that as well.\nMexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum struck a defiant tone on Saturday.\n“When we negotiate with other nations, when we talk with other nations, [it is] always with our heads held high, never bowing our heads,” Sheinbaum said speaking in Chicoloapan de Juárez, east of the country’s capital.\nTariffs are one of the few policies Trump has consistently supported for decades, a rare through-line from his days as a New York developer to his time in public office (another is immigration). As a candidate, he swore he’d use tariffs — “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” — to wield US leverage abroad.\nBut tariffs are unpopular among mainstream economists, who largely agree that tariffs cause inflation. That’s because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Newresearch from the Peterson Institute for International Economicssuggests Trump’s aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food.\nDespite running as a pro-business CEO president, corporations and business groups were apoplectic about the tariffs Saturday.\nThe US Chamber of Commerce slammed President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Saturday, warning they will raise consumer prices. In a statement, the powerful business group acknowledged that Trump is right to focus on securing the border and to fight the illicit flow of fentanyl.\n“But the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won’t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains,” said John Murphy, senior vice president and head of international at the Chamber. “The Chamber will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.\nThe Distilled Spirits Council of the US, the Chamber of the Tequila Industry and Spirits Canada said in a joint statement shared with CNN on Saturday that they are “deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries.” Last year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to US Department of Agriculture data. That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits.\nThe energy industry was unsatisfied with the reduced tariffs on Canadian oil, gas and electricity. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents Big Oil and natural gas companies, said in a statement that it wanted to be fully left out of the tariffs. It noted fuel prices would rise on the $14.4 billion of oil and natural gas imported each year from Canada.\n“We will continue to work with the Trump administration on full exclusions that protect energy affordability for consumers, expand the nation’s energy advantage and support American jobs,” API CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement.\nNEMA, which represents the electricity industry, urged the Trump administration to take a more cautious approach to tariffs, noting the electricity and the electronics industries make up a large chunk of America’s imported and exported goods and could be retaliated against.\n“We are hopeful a resolution can be quickly reached with our North American neighbors so that crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals are removed from the tariff schedule before consumers feel the impact,” said American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers CEO Chet Thompson.\nWestern Growers, which represents farmers, said the tariffs would hurt America’s food producers.\n“While we appreciate the border security issues apparently motivating the Trump Administration, rival growers of specialty crops outside of the U.S. will move quickly to seize the new business opportunities created by these tariffs to sell into the Canadian, Mexican and Chinese marketplaces,” Western Growers CEO Dave Puglia said in a statement. “Their success in doing so could permanently displace American growers from these key markets.”\nConsumer advocacy groups also warned that Trump’s plans would raise costs for Americans.\n“Tariffs are a tax increase on American households and manufacturers,” said National Taxpayers Union President Pete Sepp in a statement. “Putting a tax on goods Americans depend upon jeopardizes the Make America Great Again agenda, including the Trump Administration’s plan tounleash American energyand its efforts tolower the costof housing, food, and fuel. Instead, American families will suffer under the crushing weight of tarifflation.”\nMexico, China and Canada are the United States’ three largest trade partners.\nAnd in 2023,Mexico overtook Chinaas the top nation exporting goods to the US, marking the first time in two decades China was not the top-ranking exporter. Tariffs the first Trump administration put in place, which the Biden administration largely maintained, have negatively impacted the amount of goods the US imports from China. Mexican and Canadian goods have been imported in the US virtually duty-free as a result of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, that Trump negotiated with America’s bordering nations during his first administration.\nRelated articleTrump just gave his clearest picture yet of what new tariffs could look like\nMexico maintained that top position last year as well, exporting $467 billion worth of goods to the US, followed by China and Canada, which exported $401 billion and $377 billion worth of goods, respectively.\nThat’s according to Commerce Department figures from last year through November, the most recent month of available data. Collectively, the three countries accounted for 42% of the nearly $3 trillion worth of goods the US imported worldwide last year.\nCanada was the top country the US exported goods to last year, valued at $322 billion, followed by Mexico and China, which received $309 billion and $131 billion worth of goods from the US, respectively. US exports to the three countries accounted for over 40% of the $1.9 trillion worth of goods the US exported globally last year.\nThat means Americans could pay a lot more for a wide range of goods.\nFor instance, the US imported $87 billion worth of motor vehicles and $64 billion worth of vehicle parts from Mexico last year, not accounting for December, the top two goods imported from there that year, according to Commerce Department data. Both are likely to get more expensivealmost immediatelyafter any new tariffs are signed that impact Mexican car exports to the US.\nAutomakers have operated as if Canada, Mexico and the United States were all one unified market for decades, moving vehicles and parts across borders as they assemble vehicles. Even cars assembled at US auto plants all have parts that come from both Mexico and Canada, and vehicles assembled in those two countries have parts that come from US factories.\nCanada now accounts for nearly a quarter of steel imported by American businesses by weight, while Mexico accounts for about 12%, according to government data provided by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group.\nGas, fresh produce, consumer electronics — some of the top goods the US imports from Mexico, China and Canada — could also be set to get more expensive with blanket tariffs.\nCNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald, Matt Egan, Chris Isidore and Alicia Wallace contributed to this report."

            "text": "More than 1,100 employees at the Environmental Protection Agency received notice this week that they were deemed to be on probationary status and warning they could be fired immediately, according to an email obtained by CNN.\nProbationary employees receiving the email have been working at the agency for less than a year. The emails began to go out late on Wednesday afternoon, according to an EPA union official.\nThe same message will be sent to other agency workforces, a White House official said. Across the US government, the latest data shows there are more than 220,000 employees on probation.\n“As a probationary/trial period employee, the agency has the right to immediately terminate you pursuant to 5 CFR § 315.804,” the EPA email to probationary employees reads. “The process for probationary removal is that you receive a notice of termination, and your employment is ended immediately.”\n“Each employee’s status will be determined individually,” the email adds.\nThe email also spells out an appeals process employees can take to see if they are eligible for extra protection.\nThe approach is similar to how Elon Musk, now a key Trump adviser, handled layoffs when he bought Twitter — make a new email alias (in this case,notice@epa.gov) and thensend mass termination letters to everyone on it.\nThe US Office of Personnel Management declined to comment, and the White House and EPA did not respond to requests for additional comment.\nThe EPA union official said these probationary employees aren’t the same as at-will employees; they have less protection than tenured employees, but they have rights to appeal.\nThe union official said EPA will have to make a finding as to every single probationary employee that is being let go – either that their performance is poor or that they had a disciplinary issue. Veterans and those with tenure have extra layers of protection. Attorneys who work at the EPA and AFGE, the union representing a large number of EPA employees, are counseling people who are probationary employees on how to respond to these emails and waiting to see what further action is taken.\nThe EPA emails come after the Office of Personnel Management sent a mass email to federal workers Tuesday night telling them if they resign now, they would be paid through September 30 even though they likely wouldn’t have to work, or could at least keep working remotely.\nThe email specified that those who choose not to opt into the program – referred to as a “deferred resignation” offer – can’t be given “full assurance regarding the certainty” of their position or agency moving forward. It added that, should their job be eliminated, they “will be treated with dignity and will be afforded the protections in place for such positions.”\nThe email, sent from a new government aliasHR1@opm.gov, contained the subject line “Fork in the Road,” the same subject line of an ultimatum message Musk sent to his employees at Twitter in 2022.\nMusk has made clear in recent months that a top priority for the Department of Government Efficiency, which he is helming, would be to rid the federal workforce of employees deemed as underperforming.\nMarie Owens Powell, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, said morale at EPA was suffering.\n“It’s bad, it’s probably the worst I’ve ever seen,” she said. “I’ve never seen anything like this. Literally every day, folks are afraid to turn their computers on. They don’t know what message will be coming out next.”\nMass layoffs of probationary employees could disproportionately impact younger workers, said Rob Shriver, acting director of OPM under President Joe Biden.\n“There has been a longstanding struggle to get younger people interested in public service,” Shriver said. “We worked hard to fix that, hiring roughly 13% more people under the age of 30 in 2024 than 2023. That progress could now be undone as these young people are going to be particularly affected by this.”"

            "tags": "",
            "text": "President Donald Trump’s pick to run the FBI, Kash Patel, downplayed his past promotion of right-wing conspiracy theories and his pledges to pursue retribution against Trump’s opponents on Thursday at his combativeSenate confirmation hearing.\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee tried to pin down Patel overpast commentspraising the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, his public courtship of influencers in the QAnon conspiracy movement and his promise to go after current and former Justice Department and FBI officials that he once put on a list of “corrupt actors.”\nSo far, no Republicans have publicly stated their opposition to Patel’s nomination, and none raised concerns at the hearing. Democratic senators grilled Patel throughout the day, but he claimed they were cherry-picking excerpts of old comments to make him look bad.\nThe role of FBI director is supposed to be a 10-year term, to insulate the position from politics. After winning in November, Trump made clear that he’d fire FBI chief Chris Wray,so Wray resigned. As a result, Patel is now on a clear path to leading the FBI very soon.\nHere’s what to know about Thursday’s hearing:\nRetribution was the overarching theme of the day.\nDemocrats homed in on Patel’s well-documented record – in TV interviews, podcast appearances, his books and social media posts – of calling for punishments against the people he believes are part of the “deep state” that has attempted to undermine Trump.\nThey raised concerns about what they called an “enemies list,” from Patel’s 2023 book, “Government Gangsters.”CNN reportedthat some of the 60 officials on that list are taking drastic steps to protect their families, fearing that Patel will weaponize his FBI powers.\nRelated articlePeople on Kash Patel’s so-called ‘enemies list’ taking drastic steps for protection before his potential FBI takeover\n“I have no interest, no desire, and will not, If confirmed, go backwards,” Patel said. “There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by any FBI.”\nPatellater said, “it’s not an enemies list – that is a total mischaracterization.”\nBefore the hearing, some advisers had encouraged Patel to express regret for his comments about the people on his list. He didn’t take that path during the hearing.\nAnd during the hearing,CNN reportedthat some senior FBI leaders who were promoted by Wray were demoted or reassigned, feeding the fears of internal recriminations. Patel said during Thursday’s hearing that he wasn’t aware of any plans to punish FBI agents involved in the various Trump probes and that “no one will be terminated for case assignments.”\nDespite Patel saying he didn’t want to look backwards, Republican lawmakers encouraged him to do just that. They brought up gripes about the 2016 Trump-Russia probe, the Hunter Biden investigation and other actions they believe were motivated by anti-Trump bias.\nIn his opening statement, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the GOP chair of the Judiciary committee, said he believed that Justice Department and FBI leaders who previously investigated Trump “have yet to learn a lesson and I hope you’ll learn that lesson for them – or teach that lesson.”\nLater in the hearing, GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana asked Patel, “Do you believe in the adage that two wrongs don’t make a right – but they do make it even?”\n“Senator, I think if anyone commits a wrong in government service, the American public deserve to know every absolute detail of that corrupt activity,” Patel responded.\nThese lines of inquiry that Republicans want Patel to pursue will very likelytee up a clashbetween Patel at the FBI and other US intelligence agencies, who were also involved in the Russia probe. Patel and these agencies have tangled over this and other topics for years.\nUnder questioning from Democrats, Patel said he opposes Trump’scommutationsthat freed from prison hundreds of convicted January 6 rioters who attacked police officers.\n“I do not agree with the commutation of any sentence of any individual who committed violence against law enforcement,” he said, breaking from Trump.\nOn Trump’s first day in office, he pardoned more than 1,200 convicted rioters and granted commutations to 14 convicts tied to far-right extremist groups. These clemency actionsfreed hundreds of violent riotersfrom prison, including many who assaulted police.\n“As for January 6, I have repeatedly, often, publicly and privately, said there can never be a tolerance for violence against law enforcement,” Patel told lawmakers.\nBut Democrats argued that his comments were disingenuous, because he helped raise money forJanuary 6 defendants, including some accused of and convicted of violent felony crimes, like beating and pepper-spraying members of the US Capitol Police.\nOn the topic of January 6, there was a combative exchange between Patel and California Sen. Adam Schiff – who have been at a loggerheads for nearly a decade, dating back toboth of their serviceon the House Intelligence Committee during Trump’s first term.\nSchiff dared Patel to stand up and apologize to the US Capitol Police officers “guarding you today.” Patel declined and retorted, “how about you ask them if I have their backs?”\nPatel rebutted Democratic allegations that he was a “conspiracy theorist” by saying he believes QAnon “baseless,” despite his past praise for the movement that promotes the false notion that top Democrats are at the helm of an international pedophilia cabal.\n“I have publicly, including in the interviews provided to this committee, rejected outright QAnon baseless conspiracy theories … They must be addressed head-on with the truth and I will continue to do that,” Patel said.\nTheQAnon conspiracy theoryemerged during Trump’s first term. Adherents claim Trump was divinely selected to destroy a “deep state” network of Democratic politicians, corrupt government officials, and celebrities who worship Satan and sexually abuse children.\nPatel’s direct repudiation of QAnon wasa very different approachcompared to his past.\nHe previously courted parts of the QAnon community. On apro-Trump podcastin 2022, Patel said, “The Q thing is a movement. A lot of people attach themselves to it. I disagree with a lot of what that movement says, but I agree with what a lot of that movement says.”\nCNN haspreviously reportedthat some members of the QAnon community, including prolific right-wing influencers and podcasters, are excited about Patel’s FBI nomination.\nHe also complained that Democrats were misquoting and twisting his words about QAnon, as he did throughout the day on a variety of topics. He declined to answer many questions by repeatedly telling Democrats, “I don’t have the full quote in front of me.”\n“Snippets of information are often misleading,” Patel said at one point.\nHerepeatedly saidhe’d focus his energy on other topics like fighting drug trafficking, hunting down gangs and rapists, and keeping the country safe from foreign terrorism.\nCNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz, Devan Cole and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report."

            "text": "On Friday afternoon, around the same time a delegation of senior Canadian officials was preparing to meet with President Donald’s Trump’s border czar in a bid to stave off withering new tariffs, Trump himself essentially told them from afar: Don’t bother.\nRelated articleTrump announces significant new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China\n“No,” he said when asked by a reporter in the Oval Office if there was anything Canada, Mexico or China could do to forestall the new tariffs he’d promised to apply by February 1. “Not right now.”\nTwenty-four hours later, he made good.\nFrom his Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday — after a round of golf nearby — Trump signed new 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with lower 10% tariffs on China, setting the stage for a continental trade war among the United States’ top trading partners. Included in his order is a retaliation clause — all but guaranteeing the tariff rates could rise, given both Mexico and Canada have vowed reprisals.\nAfter threatening for months to impose steep tariffs on the United States’ neighbors,Trump’s decision to imposethe stiff new duties should hardly come as a surprise. Still, until the final hours before Trump’s start-of-month deadline, many on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill – not to mention in Ottawa and Mexico City – held out hope he might back off.\nThe delegation of senior Canadian officials had been in Washington for several days, meeting with various administration officials – including border czar Tom Homan – to try to avert the imposition of 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods that Trump had promised for February 1.\nTraveling across Washington armed with videos and documents showing a reinforced US-Canada border, Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly hoped to demonstrate the steps her country had taken to fulfill Trump’s demands that more be done to stop flows of illegal immigration.\nYet it has never been particularly clear what Canada and Mexico could do specifically to avoid the new tariffs – least of all to those country’s negotiators, who spent most of January working to ascertain what, if anything, they could do to appease Trump’s demands.\nBy the time Trump signed the tariffs Saturday afternoon, a top aide suggested nothing less than a complete stop in illegal immigration and an end to US fentanyl deaths would satisfy Trump’s demands.\nRelated articleYour complete guide to tariffs: How much you’ll pay, and when\n“There’s going to be a wide range of metrics. In Donald Trump’s golden age, we will have only legal immigration, and we will have zero Americans dying from Chinese slash Mexican slash Canadian fentanyl,” the White House official said.\nAnd at the end of a week that saw the first major retreat of Trump’s second administration – on a budget office order to freeze trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans, which was rescinded after widespread confusion and chaos – there was little question in the minds of many Trump allies that he would follow through on his tariff pledge in some capacity.\n“We’re not looking for a concession,” Trump said Friday in the Oval Office. “We’ll just see what happens.”\nTrump’s declaration he wasn’t looking for concessions hardly seemed like the final word on the matter. When he first warned in November of his plans to levy tariffs, he said they would “remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”\nSaturday’s moves are likely to thrust open a new trade battle, one being waged on issues that have little to do with trade itself. Instead, Trump appears intent on using tariffs as a weapon to enact his domestic policies: curbing flows of undocumented migrants and drugs into the United States.\nFew inside the White House ever believed Trump would let his own February 1 deadline come and go without doing anything.\nTariffs, after all, are one of the few policies Trump has consistently supported for decades, a rare through-line from his days as a New York developer to his time in public office (another is immigration). As a candidate, he swore he’d use tariffs – “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – to wield US leverage abroad.\nWell before he was officially sworn in, Trump offered little indication he would back away from his threats. Business executives hoping to talk him out of his plans got little traction, and Trump advisers bluntly said the president was unlikely to alter course.\nRelated video‘A risky gamble’: Matt Egan explains how Trump’s tariffs may increase price of gas and food for Americans\nA 12-hour episode last weekend also proved illustrative for the president and his team. After the president imposed crushing tariffs on Colombia following its president’s refusal to accept repatriation flights of deportees on military planes, the country retreated almost immediately. The quick back-down demonstrated the effectiveness of tariffs as a negotiating tool, officials said.\nSaturday’s tariffs amount to a starting gun on what could escalate into a global trade war, with the potential for higher costs, disrupted supply chains and a loss of jobs. The duties he approved Saturday have a lower 10% rate on Canadian energy, a tacit acknowledgement that the tariffs could lead to higher gas prices.Even Trump acknowledged the potential for adverse consequences on American consumers.\n“There could be some temporary, short-term disruption, and people will understand that,” Trump said Friday when pressed by reporters on the cost of tariffs being passed on to importers, and, by extension, consumers. “But the tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong – and we’re going to treat other countries very fairly.”\nSaturday’s tariffs are unlikely to be Trump’s last. The president said himself said in the Oval Office that additional tariffs could come by mid-February on chips, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminum, copper, oil and gas imports – along with tariffs on the European Union – all threats that few would discount given his willingness to follow through on the North American and China tariffs on Saturday.\nTrump himself said in the Oval Office that additional tariffs could come by mid-February on chips, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminum, copper, oil and gas imports – along with tariffs on the European Union – all threats that few would discount given his willingness to follow through on the North American and China tariffs on Saturday.\nInside the White House, key advisers had advocated for a tough approach in an early demonstration of Trump’s willingness to follow through on one of his top campaign pledges: to use tariffs as a cudgel in order to extract concessions, even from top US allies.\nHoward Lutnick, Trump’s incoming commerce secretary and former top executive at the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, had been a key supporter of the maximalist tariff approach, according to people familiar with the matter. Stephen Miller, the influential deputy chief of staff with a broad policy remit, had been another top advocate within the West Wing for a muscular opening salvo in Trump’s tariff policy.\nStill, even Lutnick acknowledged during his Senate confirmation hearings this week that offramps existed for Canada and Mexico to avoid the harsh duties Trump had promised.\n“If we are your biggest trading partner, show us the respect. Shut your border and end fentanyl coming into this country. So it is not a tariff per se; it is an action of domestic policy,” Lutnick said.\n“If they execute it, there will be no tariff,” he said.\nNot all of Trump’s economic advisers appeared quite as hawkish. Market-minded officials like Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury secretary, have advocated for a softer approach. Specifically, Bessent advocated for starting tariffs at 2.5% and gradually increasing them, according to theFinancial Times– a plan Trump quickly said he would reject.\n“No, that would not be acceptable to me,” Trump told reporters. Trump added that he would want it to be “much, much bigger.”\nThis story and headline have been updated with new reporting."

            "text": "The website of the US Agency for International Development went offline without explanation Saturday as thousands of furloughs, layoffs and program shutdowns continued amid President Donald Trump’sfreeze on US-funded foreign aidand development worldwide.\nCongressional Democrats have battled the Trump administration increasingly openly, expressing concern that Trump may be headed toward ending USAID as an independent agency and absorbing it into the State Department. Democrats say Trump has no legal authority to eliminate a congressionally funded independent agency, and that the work of USAID is vital to national security.\nTrump and congressional Republicans say much of foreign aid and development programs are wasteful. They single out programs they say advance liberal social agendas.\nThe fear of even tougher administration action against USAID comes two weeks into the administration’s shutdown of billions of dollars of the United States’ humanitarian, development and security assistance.\nRelated articleAs humanitarian officials warn people could die as a result of Trump’s foreign aid halt, Rubio issues new waiver\nThe US is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid by far. It spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance, a smaller share overall than some other countries.\nAdministration officials had no comment Saturday when asked about concerns expressed by lawmakers and others that Trump may be planning to end USAID as an independent agency.\nPresident John F. Kennedy created USAID at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency. USAID today is at the center of US challenges to the growing influence of China, which has a successful“Belt and Road”foreign aid program of its own.\nUSAID staffers spent Friday and Saturday in group chats monitoring the fate of their agency, giving updates on whether the USAID flag and signs were still up outside headquarters in Washington. As of late Saturday afternoon, they were.\nIn a Friday post on X, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said presidents cannot eliminate congressionally appropriated federal agencies by executive order, and said Trump was poised to “double down on a constitutional crisis.”\n“That’s what a despot — who wants to steal the taxpayers’ money to enrich his billionaire cabal — does,” Murphy said.\nBillionaire Elon Musk,advising Trump in a campaignto whittle down the federal government in the name of efficiency, endorsed posts on his X site calling for dissolving USAID.\n“Live by executive order, die by executive order,” Musk posted Saturday in reference to USAID.\nRelated articleUS foreign aid freeze is upending global aid and the work of contractors\nTrump placed an unprecedented 90-day freeze on foreign assistance on his first day in office January 20. Days later, the State Department froze nearly all foreign assistance worldwide, shutting down thousands of programs around the world and forcing the furloughs or layoffs of many thousands.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubiohas since movedto keep more kinds of strictly life-saving emergency programs going during the freeze. Aid groups say confusion surrounding what programs are still allowed to operate is contributing to paralysis in global aid organizations.\nRubio said Thursday, in his first public comments on the matter, that USAID’s programs were being reviewed to eliminate any that are not in the national interest, but he said nothing about eliminating USAID as an agency.\nThe shutdown of US-funded programs during the 90-day review meant the US was “getting a lot more cooperation” from recipients of humanitarian, development and security assistance, Rubio said.\nRepublicans and Democrats have fought over the agency for years, arguing whether humanitarian and development aid protects the US by helping stabilize partner countries and economies, or whether it is a waste of money. Republicans typically push to give the State Department more control of USAID’s policy and funds, while Democrats typically build USAID autonomy and authority.\nA version of that legal battle played out in Trump’s first term, when the president tried to cut the budget for foreign operations by a third.\nWhen Congress refused, the Trump administration used freezes and other tactics to cut the flow of funds already appropriated by Congress for foreign programs. The General Accounting Office later ruled that it violated a law known as the Impoundment Control Act."

            "text": "No longer just campaign trail rhetoric, President Donald Trump’s insistence that immigration to the United States amounts to an “invasion” may be critical to unlocking extraordinary powers as the administration carries out his deportation agenda.\nMultiple executive orders and agency memos use the word “invasion” to describe why Trump is taking actions that tighten the US border, empower state and local officials to carry out immigration enforcement, and take a more aggressive approach to detaining and deporting migrants.\nSome orders signed by Trump last week use “Invasion” in their titles, andone proclamation is built specificallyaround a constitutional provision that says the federal government is obligated to protect the states “against invasion.” In another early action, Trump issued anational emergency declarationthe described an “invasion” at the border that “has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years.”\nThe word choice is intentional.\nRelated articleTracking Trump’s executive actions\nLegal experts believe the administration could try to rely on the invasion rationale to justify possible future actions that would go beyond the limits of immigration law and that would ignore the procedures in place for border-crossers.\n“The invasion point comes in here, because the most basic and longstanding purpose to having a military is to stop people from invading your country. And that’s what’s happening at the southern border,” said Ken Cuccinelli, who served as the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security in the first Trump administration. “The president doesn’t need anything beyond his commander in chief authority to block people from crossing the border illegally.”\nIt also previews how the Justice Department will defend his immigration agenda in court, hoping to capitalize on how courts have historically deferred to a president’s actions in instances of a national emergency.\n“He is trying to invoke a fiction in order to increase the power of the president in ways that are completely inapplicable to this situation,” said Lucas Guttentag, a Stanford Law professor who founded the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and who served in top roles in Democratic administration.\nThe language harkens to constitutional provisions that give federal government and states special powers in times of invasion. The possible invocation of the1798 Alien Enemies Actis also hanging over how Trump’s anti-immigration agenda is being framed so far. That law, which Trump touted on the campaign trail, allows the federal government to depart from the usual procedures for detentions and deportations in a time of “Invasion or predatory incursion.”\n“We are not there yet,” said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and Georgetown University Law Center professor, but, “we may well be in for a very, very big, pitched legal battle over whether there really is an invasion along the southern border and what the legal consequences are of that are.”\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that “tens of millions of unvetted illegal migrants and literal tons of illicit drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine poured over the southern border into American communities over the last four years.”\n“That is an invasion, and the American people recognize that this the reality – that’s why they delivered a resounding mandate to President Trump to secure our border and communities,” Desai said.\nThe embrace of the invasion idea picks up on claims that states like Texas were making in legal disputes with the Biden administration over what role they could play in policing the border.\nIn addition to the Constitution’sguaranteethat the federal government shall protect states from invasion, anotherprovisionallows states to engage in war when they are “actually invaded.”\n“When you put those two things together, what do you get?” said Joshua Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law. “If a president declares an invasion, a state can engage in war.”\nThe argument could allow states to take actions that federal law would normally foreclose, Blackman said, but the proposition will have to be tested in court.\n“It’s significant constitutional power that hasn’t really been discussed at all,” Blackman said.\nThe administration has emphasized it’s looking for help from the states in its efforts to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants. Last week, then-acting Homeland Security Secretaryreleased a memo,pivoting off of Trump’s invasion-oriented executive orders, that made a finding of a “mass influx” of migrants to trigger new state authorities for immigration enforcement.\nAccording to Vladeck, the administration’s use of such language gives “cover” to state officials like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott who have sought for their states to take a more direct role in immigration enforcement.\nTexas, for instance, has used the “invasion” rationalein courtto defend a state law, challenged by the Biden administration, that allows state officials to arrest and detain people suspected of entering the country illegally.\nLegal experts see the invasion motif as a signal for powers that Trump administration may seek to exercise to take his anti-immigration agenda even further and to potentially try to overcome laws imposed by Congress that traditionally dictate border policy.\nIlya Somin, a professor of law at George Mason University, pointed to past instances where courts struck down attempts to end all asylum procedures at the border, concluding such moves as violations of the Refugee Act.\n“Part of the purpose of the invasion argument is they say, ‘Well, that overrides statutory constraints that Congress might otherwise put in place,’” Somin said.\nThe invasion language could also be “setting the stage” for invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, Vladeck said, referring to the 1798 statute last used during World War II that would let the government eschew the due process protections afforded to immigrants before they can be deported.\nThe law was referenced in a Trump executive order last week that designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\nRelated articleWhat is ICE and how are its priorities changing?\nAlready, Trump is repeating a playbook he used in his first administration to get around the congressional appropriations process. With another measure signed last week, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, in effort to direct military resources towards border security. Trump faced lawsuits when he used a similar maneuver during his first term to funnel Defense Department funding towards building a border wall.\nCourts may be more willing to defer to this kind of gambit than other Trump efforts to get around federal law, said Matthew Lindsay, a University of Baltimore School of Law professor. He noted, however, that the immigration crisis is not what it was 2023 in, as the numbers of border crossing have dropped considerably since that highpoint.\n“Lurking behind this, there is a real separation of powers question about what extent courts are going to be keeping Congress involved in the types of appropriations decisions Congress passes,” he said.\nA key question underlying Trump’s strategy will be whether courts believe they can review a president’s determination that an influx of migrants can qualify as an “invasion” or if they see that as the type of “political question” they have no power to decide.\nIf they chose the latter course, “that would give the president a blank check to declare an invasion pretty much anytime he wants, and then use that to suspend everyone’s civil liberties,” Somin said.\nOne prominent judge has recently floated the idea. In a 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last summer siding with Texas in a dispute with the Biden administration over buoys the state placed in the Rio Grande, Judge James Ho wrote a partial dissent that seemed to embrace an invasion justification being put forward by the state, while describing the invasion determination as a political question that was not up courts to decide.\nRelated articleJudge blocks Trump’s ‘blatantly unconstitutional’ executive order that aims to end birthright citizenship\n“Ho is the only federal judge, of the ones who have considered the issue, to have to some extent, at least, endorsed the invasion argument,” Somin said. “Everyone else has rejected it.”\nHo, seen as on the shortlist for possible Supreme Court nominees if Trump is given an opening on the high court, also recentlyfloated the invasion ideaas a possible exception to the principle of birthright citizenship, which Trump is trying to end for children born to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders.\nSupporters of Trump’s agenda are confident courts will defer to his determination that an invasion is occurring at the southern border. Other legal experts who are more skeptical say the context in which he is making the argument will likely matter a great deal.\n“It may just depend on their appetite for just standing by and allowing the administration to accumulate these instances of unchecked authority,” Lindsay said.\nCNN’s Priscilla Alavarez contributed to this report."

            "text": "Over and over at a confirmationhearing on Wednesday, Democratic senators confronted Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about controversial comments they said he had made in the past. And over and over, President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services either denied having said those things or said he wasn’t sure he had said them.\nSo CNN reviewed his comments in context — listening to full recordings of his interviews and poring over one of his books. We found that Kennedy did make some of the comments he denied making or claimed not to remember whether he had made, though there was at least one case in which his Wednesday denial was accurate.\nHere is a look at sixof the exchanges Kennedy had with members of the Senate Finance Committee:\nSen. Michael Bennet of Coloradoasked Kennedy, “Did you write in your book, and I (quote): ‘It’s undeniable that African AIDS is an entirely different disease from Western AIDS.’ Yes or no, Mr. Kennedy?”\nKennedy responded, “I’m not sure.”\nRelated articleRFK Jr. clashes with Democrats over past comments about vaccines, abortion rights\nFacts First:Kennedydid write that, word for word, in a 2021 book.\nThe sentence cited by Bennet appeared in a Kennedy book called “The Real Anthony Fauci.” It was part of a conspiratorial section in which Kennedy baselessly insinuated that the number of people diagnosed with AIDS in Africa had been inaccurately inflated to enrich people whose organizations get money to help fight the disease on that continent.\nThe book makes clear that Kennedy wasn’t claiming that the science of the disease itself is different among Africans than among Westerners. Rather, he was claiming, baselessly, that it is suspicious that the statistics on the demographics of people with AIDS in Africa — for example, the fact thata large percentage of Africans diagnosed with the disease are heterosexual women— are different from the statistics on the demographics of people with AIDS in Western countries.\nSen. Raphael Warnock of GeorgiasaidKennedy had compared the work of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to “Nazi death camps.”\nKennedy said, “Senator, I don’t believe that I ever compared the CDC to Nazi death camps. I support the CDC.” When Warnock asked him whether he is retracting his statement, Kennedy said, “I’m not retracting it; I never said it.” Then, when Warnock read out a quote in which Kennedy used the words “Nazi death camps,” Kennedy said, “I was not comparing the CDC to Nazi death camps; I was comparing the injury rate to our children to other atrocities. And I wouldn’t compare, of course, the CDC to Nazi death camps.”\nFacts First:Kennedy did compare the CDC to Nazi death camps. He did so in 2013 while baselessly linking vaccines to autism in children.\nAt a 2013 conference for the parents of children with autism, an audience memberasked Kennedya question about the CDC and autism (some of the question is inaudible in a low-quality recording of the event). In his response, Kennedy told a story about the CDC supposedly turning down a past offer from the “vaccine industry” to remove harmful material from vaccines.\nKennedy said, “I can’t tell you why they did it,” but that he has seen people get caught up in institutional “vortexes” in which they “go to extremes” and make decisions merely to “protect themselves.” He then said, “To me, this is like Nazi death camps.”\nHe then asked, “What happened to these kids?” citing the prevalence of autism in boys. Moments later, he returned to his comparison between the Nazis and the CDC’s supposed decisions on vaccines, saying, “I can’t tell you why somebody would do something like that. I can’t tell you why ordinary Germans participated in the Holocaust.”\nBennetasked Kennedy, “Did you say that exposure to pesticide causes children to become transgender?”\nKennedy responded, “No, I never said that.”\nFacts First:Kennedy has not explicitly declared that “exposure to pesticides causes children to become transgender,” but he has promoted that unfounded conspiracy theory using slightly different language. As CNN’s KFILEreported in 2023, Kennedy has a history of touting the baseless idea that man-made chemicals in the environment, such as a herbicide called atrazine, could be making children transgender or gay.\nRelated articleRFK Jr.’s litany of controversial views to come under scrutiny in Senate confirmation hearing\nTo cite just one example, Kennedy spoke in a 2023 interview about how atrazine can “chemically castrate and forcibly feminize” frogs, and he said, without providing any evidence, that “if it’s doing that to frogs, there’s a lot of other evidence that it’s doing it to human beings as well.”\nHe alsosaidin the interview: “I think a lot of the problems we see in kids, and particularly boys, it’s probably underappreciated of that, how much of that, is coming from chemical exposures, including a lot of the sexual dysphoria that we’re seeing.”Gender dysphoria(not “sexual dysphoria”), which is often experienced by transgender people, is the psychological distress some people feel when there is a difference between their sex assigned at birth and their gender identity.\nA spokesperson for Kennedy’s unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign told CNN in 2023: “Mr. Kennedy’s remarks are being mischaracterized. He is not claiming that endocrine disruptors are the only or main cause of gender dysphoria. He is merely suggesting that, given copious research on the effects on other vertebrates, this possibility deserves further research.”\nSen. Tina Smith of Minnesotasaid, “In an interview in 2023 and again in 2024, you blamed school shootings on antidepressants. You said, and this is a quote, ‘There is no time in American history or human history that kids were going to shoot schools and shooting their classmates. It really started happening coterminous with the introduction of these drugs, with Prozac and with other drugs.’ So do you believe, as you’ve said, that antidepressants cause school shootings? This is a — should be a simple question.”\nKennedy responded, “I don’t think anybody can answer that question; I didn’t answer that question. I said it should be studied along with other potential culprits,” mentioning “social media.”\nFacts First:Kennedy has gone further than merely saying, “It should be studied along with other potential culprits.” Though he has indeed repeatedly called for more research into the possibility of a link between antidepressants and school shootings,includingin the 2023 interview Smith was quoting here, he has also lent support to the unfounded notion that there is indeed a link.\nFor example, in a2023 public conversationwith tech billionaire Elon Musk, Kennedy made his usual call for additional research into “the role of psychiatric drugs in these events” — butthen saidmoments later that there is “tremendous circumstantial evidence that those, likeSSRIsandbenzosand other drugs, are doing this.”\nSmith said to Kennedy, “You’ve described Americans who take mental health medications as addicts who need to be sent to wellness farms to recover. Is that what you believe?”\nKennedy responded, “No, of course I didn’t say that anybody should be compelled to do anything.”\nSmith said, “No, but you said they should be sent.”\nKennedy said, “I said it should be available to them. I didn’t say they should be sent.”\nVerdict:Kennedy was correct here. Hedidn’t sayAmericans taking legal mental health medications “should be sent” to the “wellness farms” he had proposed creating.\nRather, in a 2024 interview, he suggested that such rural rehabilitation centers could be used to treat people convicted of drug crimes, then said that people seeking to get themselves off of legal medications, such as those used to treat depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), could voluntarily go to the centers “if they want to.”\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregonsaidthat although Kennedy now denies he is anti-vaccine, Kennedy said on a 2023 podcast that “no vaccine is safe and effective.”\nKennedyrespondedby asserting that Wyden’s claim has “been repeatedly debunked.”\nKennedy continued, “That statement that I made on the ‘Lex Fridman Podcast’ was a fragment of the statement. He asked me — and anybody who actually goes and looks at that podcast will see this — he asked me, ‘Are there vaccines that are safe and effective?’ And I said to him, ‘Some of the live virus vaccines are,’ and I said, ‘There are no vaccines that are safe and effective,’ and I was gonna continue, ‘For every person; every medicine has people who are sensitive to them, including vaccines.’ He interrupted me at that point.”\nRelated articleAhead of RFK Jr. confirmation hearings, poll shows nation divided on public health\nKennedy added: “I’ve corrected it many times, including on national TV.”\nFacts First:It’s not true that the claim that Kennedy said “no vaccine is safe and effective” has been “debunked.” As Kennedy acknowledged even in this answer, he said inthe 2023 interview with Fridman, “There’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective” — a comment in line withyears of other commentsin which Kennedy expressed anti-vaccine sentiment. It is true he preceded those comments to Fridman by saying, “I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they’re causing.”\nIt’s impossible to fact-check Kennedy’s Wednesday assertion that he would have made a more nuanced claim about vaccine safety and effectiveness had Fridman not “interrupted” him. However, areview of the videoshows Kennedy had finished his sentence before Fridman interjected; Kennedy had continued with the words, “In fact …”\nAlso, Kennedy’s interview with Fridman proceeded for more than half an hour after this exchange; Kennedy never added the nuance he now says he wanted to. And in Kennedy’s comments to Fridman immediately after this exchange, he criticized the polio vaccine — making a baseless claim that he didn’t know whether it caused more deaths than it averted."

            "text": "The Trump administration is set to expand a purge of career law enforcement officials, demanding the names of those who worked onJanuary 6, 2021, US Capitol attackand Trump-related investigations for potential removal – a move that could affect thousands.\nLeaders of the FBI were instructed Friday to provide the Justice Department by Tuesday information about all current and former bureau employees who “at any time” worked on January 6 investigations, according to an email from acting FBI director Brian Driscoll and obtained by CNN.\nThe Justice Department, according to the email, will review those employees to “determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.”\nRelated live-storyThe latest on the Trump presidency as he prepares to impose new tariffs\n“This request,” Driscoll wrote to all bureau personnel, “encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts.” The acting director noted in the email that such a list would also include him, as well as the acting deputy director.\nThe requested list, which interim DOJ leaders had spent the past week drawing up, highlights how the new administration has moved quickly to deliver on President Donald Trump’s vow to strike back at the Justice Department and FBI that he claims have been weaponized against him. Trump has falsely accused agents of abuse in their court-ordered search of his Mar-a-Lago home and of their treatment of Capitol rioters.\nThe FBI and Justice Department declined to comment.\nDriscoll attached to the email a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove with the subject line “Termination.”\n“For each employee included in the lists, provide the current title, office to which the person is assigned, role in the investigation or prosecution, and date of last activity relating to the investigation or prosecution,” Bove wrote. “Upon timely receipt of the requested information, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General will commence a review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.”\nThe Bove memo also referenced the removal of senior FBI officials, whichCNN previously reported.\n“The FBI — including the Bureau’s prior leadership — actively participated in what President Trump appropriately described as ‘a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated on the American people over the last four years’ with respect to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,” Bove said.\nThe Justice Department also requested information on FBI personnel who worked on a criminal case brought in September by the previous administration against several high-level members of Hamas over the October 7, 2023, attack.\nDriscoll said in his email that “we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what’s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people.”\nFriday’s notices of expected termination sent shockwaves throughout the FBI, line-level agents and analysts told CNN.\n“This is a massacre meant to chill our efforts to fight crime without fear or favor,” said one agent. “Even for those not fired, it sends the message that the bureau is no longer independent.”\nOne employee noted the January 6 case, which involved over a thousand defendants located across the country, was the largest investigation ever worked by the FBI.\n“Everyone touched this case,” the employee said.\nAlso on Friday, more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were fired by the Justice Department, according to communications obtained by CNN,\nThe prosecutors had worked in the US attorney’s office in Washington, DC, on a temporary basis on Capitol riot cases. But at the end of the Biden administration, their jobs were being converted to permanent status, according to a separate DOJ memo obtained by CNN and circulated across the DC US attorney’s office headed by Ed Martin.\n“The manner in which these conversions were executed resulted in the mass, purportedly permanent hiring of a group of AUSAs in the weeks leading up to President Trump’s second inauguration, which has improperly hindered the ability of acting U.S. Attorney Martin to staff his Office in furtherance of his obligation to faithfully implement the agenda that the American people elected President Trump to execute,” Bove wrote in that memo.\nRelated articleTakeaways from FBI director nominee Kash Patel’s combative confirmation hearing\n“I will not tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous Administration at any U.S. Attorney’s Office. Too much is at stake,” he added.\nThe Trump purge at DOJ’s main headquarters began last week – within minutes of the new interim leaders being sworn in – as somesenior career lawyers were notified that they were being reassignedto a task force focused to immigration-related issues and so-called sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that generally decline to assist federal deportation efforts. The reassignment is widely viewed as an effort to force out senior career officials, some of whom have since resigned.\nEmails sent by James McHenry, the acting attorney general, to those being ousted from their jobs have included language that reads: “Given your significant role in prosecuting the President, I do not believe that the leadership of the Department can trust you to assist in implementing the President’s agenda faithfully.”\nSome agents say Trump and other critics misunderstand that FBI agents and supervisors can’t choose which assignments they are given as part of their job. The FBI workforce is broadly conservative and until recently were led for years by lifelong Republican Christopher Wray.The nomination of Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, is pending in the Senate.\nMany agents initially had qualms about being assigned to the Capitol attack and Trump cases, viewing the prosecutions as heavy-handed, people familiar with the matter said. Some Justice Department lawyers leading January 6 cases complained that they believed agents sometimes slow-walked some of their work.\nShortly after Trump took office, Tom Ferguson, a former agent and aide to Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, arrived at the FBI headquarters as a policy adviser. Jordan has been a staunch FBI critic and led a subcommittee on purported weaponization of government agencies, including the FBI.\nThe FBI Agents Association officials met with Patel in recent weeks to raise concerns about possible firings of agents, urging him to protect agents who did their work investigating violent crimes with oversight from judges, FBI supervisors and Justice Department lawyers, according to people briefed on the meeting.\n“During our meeting, he said that agents would be afforded appropriate process and review and not face retribution based solely on the cases to which they were assigned,” the agents association said in a statement.\nThe statement also warned that “dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure.”\nDuring the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday on his nomination, Patel said he didn’t know of any upcoming personnel plans.\n“Are you aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, FBI agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations?” asked Democratic Sen. Cory Booker.\n“I am not aware of that, senator,” Patel replied.\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\nCNN’s Tierney Sneed and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report."

            "tags": "",
            "text": "In the first national tragedy of his second term in the White House, President Donald Trump wasted no time Thursday baselessly blaming Democrats and diversity initiatives in the federal government for the midair collision that killed 67 people over the Potomac River.\nThe investigation is in its earliest stages, but Trump’s speculation was not.\n“I have common sense, OK?” Trump said when pressed what evidence he had to give credence to the blame he piled on the Biden and Obama administrations. “Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t.”\nIt was the first time since returning to power that Trump stood in the White House briefing room to address the nation. He called the moment “an hour of anguish for our nation,” but he abruptly pivoted to a familiar script that played out during his first four years in office.\nShortly after the president declared there were “no survivors,” he pointed the finger of blame to his old political rivals, suggesting diversity initiatives led to lax aviation standards that contributed to the crash. Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed his view.\n“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump said. “I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary, you remember that. Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers.”\nHe also blasted former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who served as the only openly gay member of the Biden cabinet, sarcastically calling him “a real winner.”\n“Do you know how badly everything’s run since he’s run the Department of Transportation?” Trump said. “He’s a disaster. He was a disaster as a mayor, he ran his city into the ground, and he’s a disaster – now he’s just got a good line of bulls**t.”\nIt was a remarkable moment, with television broadcasts showing a split-screen of the recovery effort on the Potomac only miles away from the White House, as Trump spoke. Not long after he left the briefing room, Buttigieg replied on social media.\n“President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,” Buttigieg wrote. “One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.”\nTrump has taken Washington by storm with a dizzying flurry of executive actions and orders during the first 11 days of his presidency, reflecting an air that both he and his advisers are far more familiar with the workings of government than the chaotic opening of his first term.\nYet he made clear on Thursday that even as commander-in-chief, he has no plans to soften much of the bluster than was the anthem of his first term. He berated reporters in the briefing room and set off on a course of speculation and judgment.\nHe appeared to place blame for the midair collision on “very late” warnings from air traffic control and the soldiers flying the US Army Black Hawk helicopter, who, he said, “should have seen where they were going.”\n“The analysis was, it was based on vision,” Trump said, when asked about his sense of who is at fault. “You had a lot of people that saw what was happening. You had some people that knew what was happening. There was some warnings, but the warnings were given very, very late.”\nTrump did not specify which people he was referring to but seemed to be referring to air traffic control. He also questioned the helicopter’s elevation at the time of the crash.\nThe president’s comments come in spite of the fact that no investigation has yet placed blame for the crash on air traffic controllers who were working Wednesday night. It’s also not clear whose administration hired the controllers involved.\n“When I arrived in 2016, I made that change very early on, because I always felt this was a job that, and other jobs too, but this was a job that had to be superior intelligence, and we didn’t really have that,” Trump said. “And we had it. And then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever before.”\nTrump issued a presidential memorandum later on Thursday directing a review of aviation policies and what the White House referred to as “the damage done” to aviation safety under the Biden administration. The memo specifically calls for a thorough reassessment of the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) hiring practices implemented during the previous administration.\n“Elevating competence over everything else, instead of the DEI policies that were pursued by the Biden administration,” Trump said. “And Obama, yes. But Biden, much worse,” Trump quickly added.\nThe investigation into one of the nation’s deadliest aviation disasters in modern history is only now beginning. The federal authorities tasked with conducting the probe are part of the very government workforce that Trump is seeking to remake.\nThe briefing on Thursday seem to put a new spin on the sign that once adorned President Harry Truman’s desk: Instead of the buck stopping with the president, he was instead first to assign blame.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "category": "politics",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "President Donald Trumpwill move forward with aggressive new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on Saturday, the White House said, affirming he will stick to his February 1 deadline for the new duties that could have widespread effects on the economy.\n“I can confirm that, tomorrow, the February 1 deadline President Trump put into place with a statement several weeks ago continues,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during Friday’s briefing.\n﻿Canadian officials are expected to meet with White House border czar Tom Homan on Friday in a bid to reach a deal that would stave off the proposed tariffs, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\nBut asked later Friday in the Oval Office whether Canada, Mexico and China could do anything to stop the implementation of the tariffs, Trump said, “No.”\nThe White House’s confirmation of the new tariffs appeared to end speculation on whether the president would follow through on the pledge he made as a candidate to levy the new duties.\nLeavitt said the tariffs would amount to a 25% duty on Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on China “for illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans.”\n“These are promises made and promises kept by the president,” she said.\nShe didn’t provide any details on precisely how the new tariffs would be implemented, only saying that the fine print would be available for public inspection within the next 24 hours. She similarly declined to say whether they will be applied to oil imports or whether additional exemptions will be included.\n“Eventually we’re going to put tariffs on chips. We’re going to put tariffs on oil and gas. That’ll happen fairly soon,” Trump said later in the day, suggesting “around” February 18.\n“We’re going to be putting tariffs on steel, aluminum, and ultimately copper. Copper will take a little longer, but it will happen quickly,” Trump said.\nTrump also announced intentions to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals, calling it part of a broader strategy to revive US industries.\n“We’re going to build a tariff wall to bring pharmaceuticals back to America,” he said. “The way to do that is by putting up a wall— a tariff wall.”\nPlacing significant tariffs on the United States’ biggest trading partners serves as a gamble that taxing American companies for imported goods will ultimately punish the countries that make stuff Americans want — and bring those nations to the negotiating table. But it’s a risky bet that could easily backfire on American consumers and the economy.\n“There could be some temporary, short-term disruption, and people will understand that,” Trump said when pressed by reporters on the cost of tariffs being passed on to consumers.\nTrump earlier this week dismissed the idea that American consumers were reliant on imports from its two North American neighbors.\n“We don’t need what they have,” Trump said, referring to Canada and Mexico.\nEconomists largely believe that, in limited circumstances, tariffs can be effective tools for economic growth. Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.\nTrump has said he wants Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States. And for China, Trump has said tariffs would be aimed at forcing the country to make good on what he said was a stated promise to him that the government would execute people caught sending fentanyl to the United States.\nMexico’s president said Friday that her country was awaiting any potential US tariffs with a “cool head.”\n“We have a Plan A, Plan B and Plan C for whatever the US government decides. It is very important for the people of Mexico to know that we will always defend our people’s dignity, our sovereignty, and engage in dialogue as equals,” President Claudia Sheinbaum told journalists at a daily news conference.\n“No one — on either side of the border — wants to see American tariffs on Canadian goods,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday afternoon ina statement on X.\n“I met with our Canada-U.S. Council today. We’re working hard to prevent these tariffs, but if the United States moves ahead, Canada’s ready with a forceful and immediate response,” he added.\nA delegation of senior Canadian officials has been in Washington for several days, meeting with various administration officials to try to avert the imposition of 25% tariffs. And Canada’s behind-the-scenes effort could turn into a full-court press if the levies go into effect. Premiers from all of Canada’s provinces — led by Ontario Premier Doug Ford — are planning to travel to Washington on February 12 for a larger mission.\nTariffs in certain circumstances do not cause inflation problems. Trump’s first-term tariffs did not meaningfully raise inflation, although they were far narrower in scope than what he is currently proposing, and the Covid-19 pandemic skewed some of the inflationary aspects of the tariffs — many of which remained in place during the Biden administration.\nBut mainstream economists largely agree that tariffs cause inflation. That’s because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost onto consumers in the form of higher prices. Newresearch from the Peterson Institute for International Economicssuggests Trump’s aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food.\nTrump’s proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions. The Peterson Institute hasestimatedTrump’s proposed tariffs would cost the typical US householdover $2,600 a year.\nStill, some proponents of Trump’s plan say the risk is worth the reward. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, last week told CNBC that if tariffs cause a little inflation but address a national security issue, then people should“get over it.”\nThe proposed tariffs expected on Saturday would hit a far wider range of goods than anything Trump has previously imposed.\nDuring his first term, Trump’s tariffs hit roughly $380 billion of foreign goods, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. The proposed tariffs on the nation’s three largest trading partners would hit about $1.4 trillion of imported goods, if there are no exemptions, the Tax Foundation said.\nThe figures underscore how aggressive and risky Trump’s tariffs would be, especially given how much prices have spiked since then.\n“The administration is playing with fire,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\nBrusuelas noted that the vast majority of imported US avocadoes are from Mexico, which faces a 25% tariff. “Go ahead and spike taxes on avocados ahead of the Super Bowl and watch how that turns out,” he said.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nCNN’s Kayla Tausche, Matt Egan, Max Saltman, Betsy Klein and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this story."

            "category": "business",
            "tags": "",
            "text": "Opposite a bed in central London, light filters through a stained-glass window depicting,in fragments of copper and blue, Jesus Christ.\nThree people have lived in the deserted cathedral in the past two years, with each occupant — an electrician, a sound engineer and a journalist — paying a monthly fee to live in the priest’s quarters.\nThe cathedral is managed by Live-in Guardians, a company finding occupants for disused properties, including schools, libraries and pubs, across Britain. The residents — so-called property guardians — pay a fixed monthly “license fee,” which is usually much lower than the typical rent in the same area.\nApplications to become guardians are going “through the roof,” with more people in their late thirties and forties signing on than in the past, said Arthur Duke, the founder and managing director of Live-in Guardians.\n“That’s been brought about by the cost-of-living crisis,” he said. “People are looking for cheaper ways to live.”\nThe practice of populating disused properties with guardiansis unregulated in Britain and comes with fewer legal protections for the residents than renting. Guardians have also complained of inconveniences and outright hazards, such as no access to drinkable tap water and rickety ceilings.\nStill, demand for guardianships is rocketing as rents and property prices remain unaffordable for scores of people in many parts of the country.\nLuke Williams has saved “thousands and thousands of pounds on rent” as a guardian over the past six years. The 45-year-old currently lives in a former office block in east London. It’s a huge, open-plan space still dotted with whiteboards and hand sanitizer dispensers.\nWilliams said his job a project manager for a tech company pays well, yet “insane” rental costs in the British capital are keeping him in guardianships as much as his penchant for the unusual.\n“As well as making financial sense, I like the lifestyle, and I like the interesting, quirky places,” he said.\nGuardians often live in spacious buildings, in prime locations, which are due for demolition or redevelopment and whose owners want to deter squatters without paying for a round-the-clock security team.\nThe practice started in the Netherlands in the 1980s and has long attracted artists, musicians and other creatives in search of enough square footage to do their work, as well as those prepared to live more precariously. For example, in Britain, guardians can be asked to vacate the property with 28 days’ notice, compared with the two months afforded to most private renters.\nMore than 13,500 people live as guardians in Britain, according to an estimate by the Property Guardian Providers Association, compared with the11 millionrenting their home through a private landlord.\nGraham Sievers, chair of the PGPA — which represents three large guardianship providers, companies that connect property owners with guardians and manage the buildings — said demand is “the highest it’s ever been” since the practice arrived in the country about 20 years ago.\nAbout 50,000 people applied to become guardians via those three companies last year, a rise of more than two-thirds compared with 2022, the previous time the PGPA surveyed its members. Although guardianships have traditionally attracted people in their twenties, increasing numbers of thirty-somethings are signing up, said Sievers.\nIn London, much like in New York, rents have shot up in recent years as people have flocked back to big cities after the pandemic.\nThe average private rent in the British capital jumped11.5% last year, to £2,220 ($2,764) a month, according to provisional government figures. And data from SpareRoom, a popular roommate search site, shows that the average monthlyrent for a room in shared accommodation in London stood at £993 ($1,212) during the last three months of 2024.\nAccording toBen Twomey, chief executive of Generation Rent, a non-profit campaigning for renters’ rights, the typical rent in London meets the government’sdefinitionof “unaffordable,” eating up more than 30% of a renters’ pre-tax income.\nFor some, then, guardianships have offered a lifeline.\n“There’s a new type of person who is probably almost forced into (guardianship),” said Louis Goss, a 29-year-old journalist and former guardian. “Basically, that’s the only thing that’s affordable to them.”\nGoss said that what began as a “bohemian lifestyle choice” looks increasingly like a symptom of Britain’s housing crisis.\nThe governmentestimatesthat 300,000 homes need to be built each year in England alone, but housebuilding is failing to keep up with demand.\nGoss has done four separate stints as a guardian in London, in an empty police station, a nursing home for the elderly, a student residence hall and, finally, a town hall.\nIn 2019, in the police station located in the capital’s upmarket Chelsea neighborhood, Goss lived with around 50 other  guardians, most of whom had recently left college and were searching for cheap housing and new friendships. Each month, he paid a license fee of £500 ($610) — which covered bills — roughly half of what he estimates he would’ve paid as a private tenant in the same area.\nHe remembers hosting parties in the basement and its adjoining holding cells, and climbing up a fire escape to access the kitchen. The joyful chaos and camaraderie felt like being on a “pirate ship,” he said. “The feeling was very much like people had chosen to be there.”\nBut, by 2021, the mood had shifted.\nIn the student residence hall, Goss said he encountered more people in their thirties looking to save money as rents rose. Some moved into the building’s basement, which a group of elderly Catholic nuns had occupied until the pandemic forced them to make a hasty exit, leaving behind crucifixes and religious robes.\nLast year, Goss decided to walk away from guardianships and rent privately. “I had just got tired of the conditions,” he said of his final building, which came without drinkable tap water. He had noticed, too, shrinking discounts on many license fees compared with rents. The benefits of guardianship simply no longer justified the drawbacks.\nTim Lowe, founder and director of The Lowe Group, a guardianship provider, has hiked license fees in recent years as the costs of running properties, including energy bills, have skyrocketed. The fees are still lower than comparable rents, he noted, but the gap is smaller than in the past.\nLowe is adamant guardianships should be a “platform” to help people make friends or save money to buy a home, not the last resort for the vulnerable, such as those who could qualify for government-subsidized housing.\n“It’s not a life raft,” he said.\nThe UK housing ministry states in itsguidanceon guardianships that it “does not endorse or encourage” the practice because people “can be asked to live in conditions that do not meet the standards of residential properties.”\nCharley Hullah, a long-time guardian, can concur.\nThe 31-year-old musician has been a guardian in six properties since 2013. He left one after the kitchen and bathroom ceilings caved in and recalls feeling nervous every time he took a shower, which had been installed under a mass of electrical wires in an old toilet for disabled people. Twice he smelt burning.\nHe believes that providers often have “no incentive to do things in the proper way” because the buildings are set to be demolished anyway.\nThe PGPA has stepped in to supervise providers, setting standards on fire safety, for example, and conducting random inspections of buildings.\n“The property guardian model should work, and it should work well,” said Sievers at the PGPA, noting that he has asked the government to establish an agency to regulate the industry. He believes vast amounts of office space still lying vacant after the pandemic could be repurposed for guardianships to help ease Britain’s housing shortage.\nFor now, scores of Londoners are trapped in a vicious circle. Costly rents mean they are struggling to save the money needed for a down payment to buy a home, which in turn keeps them stuck in rented housing.\nTwomey at Generation Rent said renters in Britain have a particular incentive to buy as they generally enjoy fewer legal protections than their counterparts in Europe, such as guardrails against eviction and excessive rent hikes.\nBut, according to a 2023 analysis by the non-profit, it would take close to 20 years for a single person on an average income, renting in shared accommodation in London, to save enough for a down payment on a property in the city.\nThe average price of a house or apartment in London stood at more than half a million pounds in November ($635,000), according to the latest government data.\n“We’re basically losing so much of our potential to save to our landlords,” said Twomey. “It’s just impossible to pull together that money.”\nFor some, guardianships have eased that challenge.\nMavis Alaneme and her husband bought a two-bedroomapartment in a county southeast of London in 2023 after almost a decade bouncing between guardianships and rented accommodation.\nThe 40-year-old business analyst estimates she saved more than £16,000 ($19,700) in unspent rent during that time thanks to being a guardian, adding that her most recent guardianship helped her save for the down payment on her current place.\nBy the end, she was weary. Guardianship properties were often run down, the inspections by providers felt intrusive and license fees were rising.\nAlaneme has bought peace of mind with her apartment. “You just can’t match it,” she said. “To actually be here and just sit on our sofa and be like ‘no one’s going to kick us out’ unless you don’t pay the mortgage… This is ours. We’re settled. And it’s lovely. It’s a really lovely feeling.”\nBut, for others, guardianships did not turn into that much hoped-for springboard.\n“I never thought I’d be doing this for this long,” said Hullah, who lives in a disused apartment block in north London. “I thought I might be able to move up some kind of ladder into private rented (housing), but I still can’t afford it. So, I just essentially got stuck.”"

            "text": "About 18,000 Teamsters are set to strike 56 Costco stores across six states early Saturday unless an 11th-hour agreement prevents what would be the largest retail strike in US history.\nTalks resumed between the two sides Thursday, but there have been no updates on the negotiations. In addition to disagreements on wages and benefits, the union said Costco had rejected proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time,and safeguards against surveillance.\nTeamsters members at Costco make up 8% of the 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers would be significant for the largely nonunion sector. Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most of those unionized retail workers are in the grocery store sector.\nThe unionized store locations, which have not been identified by either the union or company, are in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington. Costco said on Friday that even if there is a strike and unionized workers don’t report to work, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intends to use management and nonunion staff to keep stores operating.\nMeanwhile, while the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, the union is prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of nonunion Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remain on the job. Such a move could greatly increase the economic pressure on the company. While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for those other picket lines.\nCostco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains. Its annual company filing states that “our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.”\nIn late 2023, when workers at a Costco store in Roanoke, Virginia, voted to join the Teamsters, the then-outgoing and incoming CEOs of Costco, Craig Jelinek and Ron Vachris, released a letter to employees.\n“We’re disappointed in the results in Norfolk,” the letter read. “We’re not disappointed in our employees; we’re disappointed in ourselves as managers and leaders. The fact that a majority of Norfolk employees felt that they wanted or needed a union constitutes a failure on our part.”\n“It was a pretty unique letter. I’ve never seen management take that position,” Jane Jacobs, an attorney at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, who typically represents employers in labor relations, told CNN.\nThe Teamsters have pointed to Costco’s strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package. Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a recent union rally held outside Costco’s annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker? Prove it!” and “Record profits = record contract.”\n“Costco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike,” Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said in a statement earlier this month. “If Costco thinks they can exploit our members while raking in billions, we’ll shut them down.”\nJacobs said that despite the differences at the bargaining table, there doesn’t appear to be a large difference in total cost between their bargaining positions. Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at nonunion stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years. Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20.\nJacobs said a good strategy for any employer is to give the nonunion employees the same pay and benefit package as unionized employees to remove the incentive to join the union. But she said it’s possible the Teamsters go on strike to press their current political advantage.\nO’Brien has gotten closer to President Donald Trump than many labor leaders, Jacobs said. He spoke at the Republican National Convention and did not endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\nMeanwhile, Costco has refused to back off of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, which have become a focus of Trump’s attacks in the early days of the new term. Jacobs said she could see Trump publicly taking the side of the Teamsters if it goes on strike at Costco to put pressure on the company.\n“This union is set up as well as any union to go on strike,” she said. “One thing we know about this administration is they’ll reward their friends and punish their enemies.”\nMichael Baker, retail analyst at DA Davidson, said that while a strike at only 8% of Costco stores probably isn’t enough to prove a significant financial hit to the company’s bottom line, a deal that is seen as a win for the union could spur organizing efforts at other stores across the chain.\nKatherine Black, a partner in the food, drug and mass market retail segment at management consulting firm Kearney, told CNN that a strike would likely not last more than a week.\n“It’s very rare in this sector for a strike to lasts more than a few days,” she said. “The longest I know of was one at Stop & Shop in 2019 that lasted 11 days.”\nLast year, the Teamsters staged a five-daystrike at Amazonthat ended the day after Christmas. But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract. Amazon doesn’t even recognize that many of the strikers, who are drivers for third-party delivery services and have exclusive contracts with the online retailer, are its employees."

            "text": "President Donald Trump has fired Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nChopra received an email from the White House on Saturday morning informing him of the firing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\nChopra, who has been targeted by Republican lawmakers for putting restrictions on financial institutions in favor of consumers, announced his departure in a post on X on Saturday.\n“This letter confirms that my term as CFPB Director has concluded. I know the CFPB is ready to work with you and the next confirmed Director, and we have a great deal of energy to ensure continued success,”Chopra wrote.\nThe CFPB declined to comment on the news.\n“It’s the executive’s decision and prerogative to see who they want in that role,” a White House official told CNN.\nMajor consumer banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are among companies facing lawsuits from the CFPB. They, alongside tech industry leaders, have encouraged Trump to remove Chopra from his role — which was made possible by a2020 Supreme Court rulingthat enabled presidents to fire CFPB directors.\nChopra was appointed in 2021 by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the bureau that regulates financial agencies. The director of the CFPB, who under law was to serve a five-year term, also serves as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, voting on key banking regulations. Chopra will no longer be serving in that role either.\nIn his time at the CFPB, Chopra spearheaded controversial regulation limitingoverdraft feesbanks can charge as well as late fees credit card companies could collect from customers.\nThe rule intending to cap credit card late fees at $8 was laterstruck downby a federal judge. The CFPB rule on overdraft fees, which would cap them at $5 — a substantial savings from the $35 that customers are typically charged — was finalized at the end of last year but islikely to face legal challenges, as well.\nUnder Chopra’s leadership, the CFPB alsofinalizeda rule making personal data more accessible so that it is easier to switch banks. Before Trump took office this month, the agencyfinalizeda rule that would remove about $49 billion in medical bills from credit reports.\n“People who get sick shouldn’t have their financial future upended,” said Chopra in a statement on January 7.\nThe consumer watchdog agency was created after the 2008 financial crisis by way of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The agency was the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who began advocating for it in 2007 when she was a Harvard Law School professor.\nWarren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, applauded Chopra for “holding Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families,” she said Saturday in a statement.\nDespite their differences with Trump, Warren and several progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, have signaled their support for the president’s campaign promise to temporarily cap credit interest rates at 10% — less than half of current rates according to Federal Reserve data.\nTo fulfill this promise, Warren said Trump “needs a strong CFPB and a strong CFPB director,” adding that “if President Trump and Republicans decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.”\nCNN’s Jeanne Shahadi contributed to this report.\nThis story has been updated with additional content."

            "text": "President Donald Trump says he will impose his tariffs over the weekend, gambling that taxing American companies for imported goods will ultimately punish the countries that make stuff Americans want — and bring those nations to the negotiating table. But it’s a risky bet that could easily backfire on American consumers and the economy.\nIn the United States, tariffs typically serve a limited but important purpose: They are intended to grow America’s economy by incentivizing the purchase of made-in-the-USA goods. They accomplish that by effectively penalizing American companies that buy foreign goods with high taxes.\nEconomists largely believe that, in limited circumstances, tariffs can be effective tools for economic growth. But Trump believes that tariffs have an altogether different purpose.\nTrump has long praised tariffs as effective economic policy. On Monday, Trump called “tariff” the fourth-most beautiful word in the dictionary, behind “God,” “love” and “religion.”\nAnd Trump has repeatedly (and incorrectly) said that “the tariff sheriff,” former President William McKinley, ushered in an era of American prosperity at the end of the 19th century by going all-in on tariffs. Though the US economy was growing strong in the 1890s, that was largely on the back of practically unrestricted immigration, among other factors.\nStill, Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.\nAmerica is running massive deficits, and Trump’s tax cut plan could put the budget even deeper in the hole. Trump has said the tariffs will make up for lost revenue: He predicted last week in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum that the tariffs would bring in hundreds of billions of dollars — perhaps trillions of dollars — into the US Treasury.\nTrump routinely criticizes American trade policy for “subsidizing” Canada and Mexico, saying America is “losing” hundreds of billions of dollars to its neighboring nations. Trump isimprecisely talking about the trade gap, the difference between what America exports and imports. Some economists caution that Trump’s language about America’s trade gap presents an unfair representation of what has become a crucial mechanism for the US economy — its ability to purchase services offered by other countries as well as stuff that isn’t made here much, like coffee.\nAnd Trump likes tariffs because they can force countries to give up something he believes is in America’s best interest. Although tariffs are charged to importers, they can dissuade buyers from purchasing goods from tariffed countries, hurting those nations’ economies. That has led some of them to seek agreements to avoid tariffs. Trump has said he wants Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States. And for China, Trump has said tariffs would be aimed at forcing the country to make good on what he said was a stated promise to him that the government would execute people caught sending fentanyl to the United States.\nTrump and his administration have been consistent: Tariffs in some form are coming on Saturday. But they’ve offered conflicting information about what tariffs would be announced this weekend.\nDuring an Oval Office signing ceremony on his first day in office, Trump said he would impose 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico and Canada on February 1. The next day he said he would place a 10% tariff on all goods from China on February 1. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Wednesday that February 1 was when tariffs would go into effect. And again on Thursday from the Oval Office, Trump said his administration will be announcing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Saturday. Friday, Leavitt rebutted a Reuters report that suggested tariffs could be delayed, stating that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would be put in place Saturday.\nBut Trump atan address to House Republicanson Mondayspelled out specific itemsthat his administration would tariff — rather than across-the-board tariffs — including pharmaceuticals, microchips and steel. Confusingly, earlier that day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was pushing for a plan to begin with a 2.5% tariff on all goods and gradually increase them, according to theFinancial Times. But Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he would reject that plan, saying “that would not be acceptable to me,” saying tariffs needed to be “much, much bigger.”\nThere’s widespread doubt on Wall Street that Trump will rush to put into effect those massive tariffs in full force on Saturday. To enact tariffs, Trump will probably declare a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as “IEEPA,” which unilaterally authorizes a president to manage imports during a national emergency,CNN has previously reported. But Chris Krueger, an analyst at TD Securities, noted that Trump has not yet triggered the IEEPA statute and is running out of time to get that done for Saturday’s promised tariffs.\nIf not Saturday — or if some limited tariffs go in place Saturday — more severe tariffs could be put in place later this year. Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, hinted at a second wave of tariffs against Mexico and Canada that could come in the spring — perhaps April. He suggested that the initial tariffs, coming as soon as Saturday, are “action-oriented” tariffs aimed at reducing fentanyl and illegal immigrants coming over the US border.\nAnd he said those action-oriented tariffs may be avoided altogether: “As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,” Lutnick said Wednesday at his confirmation hearing. “And if they don’t, then there will be.”\nCanada has been hoping to avoid tariffs by doing just that, working with the United States and pledging Wednesday to stand up a “strike force”on fentanyl to hit drug traffickers “harder and faster,” deploying two Black Hawk helicopters, 60 drones and new specially trained canine teams at the border.\nCanada’s foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday she was hopeful to avoid tariffs after her meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but she acknowledged that no one knows what will happen February 1 — only the president, she said.\nBut Canada is also preparing to retaliate against tariffs, if necessary. Canadian officials are working on a list of dozens of American products that the United States exports to Canada, targeting items that both send a political message and inflict a reasonable amount of economic damage, two sources said, including ceramic products, steel products, furniture, certain alcoholic beverages like Bourbon and Jack Daniels whiskey, orange juice and pet food, among other goods.\nThe second kind of tariff, which Lutnick said would be “ordinary tariffs,” could be executed after a study on the macroeconomic effects of levying import taxes on America’s neighbors. That study will be concluded by April, as mandated by an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office, Lutnick said.\nTrump has also proposed 10% tariffs on all other goods coming into America, though he said last week his administration wasn’t ready to implement those just yet. And he proposed tariffs on Denmark to incentivize it to give control of Greenland to the United States. (He has also threatened to use military force to take Greenland.) Trump on Thursday said that goods from BRICS nations — a coalition of emerging economies backed by China and Russia — would face 100% tariffs if they attempted to move away from the US dollar in international trade.\nImportantly, Trump has a history of threatening tariffs, only to later rescind them. Last week, for example, he announced steep tariffs on Colombia in retaliation for failing to accept US miliary planes with deportees. Ten hours later, he said the tariffs would not go in place after Colombia reversed its stance.\nIn 2019, Trump threatened a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports that would rise to 25% if Mexico declined to take action to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border with the United States. But after Mexican officials traveled to Washington for a week of in-person negotiations — and an agreement was reached to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy — the tariffs were never implemented.\nIf Trump follows through with limited tariffs, he has said they’d be focused on pharmaceuticals, steel and computer chips. Trump on Thursday said oil might not be part of any tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and his administration would make that determination as early as Thursday night.\nBut if tariffs are broader, that could raise prices on many common purchases, because Mexico, China and Canada are America’s top trading partners. Some prices could rise quite quickly.\nFor example, because most American cars are partially made in Mexico and Canada, the tariffs would add a minimum of thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, according to experts.\nGas, food and alcohol priceswould also riseif Trump imposed Canadian and Mexican tariffs.\nSneakerprices would riseif Trump raised tariffs on China: About 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, mostly from China, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands. America also gets the vast majority of its electronics from there.\nTariffs in certain circumstances do not cause inflation problems. Trump’s first-term tariffs did not meaningfully raise inflation, although they were far narrower in scope than what Trump is currently proposing, and the pandemic that follow skewed some of the inflationary aspects of the tariffs — many of which remained in place during the Biden administration.\nBut mainstream economists largely agree that tariffs cause inflation. That’s because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Newresearch from the Peterson Institute for International Economicssuggests Trump’s aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food.\nThey also can lead to trade wars. China, Europe and Canada, for example, retaliated against America with their own tariffs on particular items after the first Trump administration levied tariffs on certain items from those nations.\nTrump’s proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions. The Peterson Institute hasestimatedTrump’s proposed tariffs would cost the typical US householdover $2,600 a year.\nStill, some proponents of Trump’s plan say the risk is worth the reward. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, last week told CNBC that if tariffs cause a little inflation but address a national security issue, then people should“get over it.”\nLutnick echoed those remarks Wednesday.\n“If Canada is going to rely on America for its economic growth, how about you treat our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen with respect?” he said. “And so I think the president and our Trump administration is focused on improving the lives of our producers.”\nIn the end, Lutnick argued tariffs mean “the economy of the United States will be much, much better.”\nCNN’s Matt Egan, Elisabeth Buchwald, Alicia Wallace, Kayla Tausche and Paula Newton contributed reporting."

But DEI backers, including most top US companies, believe a push for diversity has been good for their businesses.\nTrump did not cite any evidence for how efforts to hire more minorities, people with disabilities and other groups less represented in American workforces led to the crash, saying “it just could have been” and that he had “common sense.” But Trump criticized the FAA’s effort to recruit people with disabilities during Joe Biden’s administration, even though the FAA’sAviation Safety Workforce Planfor the 2020-2029 period, issued under Trump’s first administration, promoted and supported “the hiring of people with disabilities and targeted disabilities.”\nIt’s not the first time opponents of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, have said they can kill people. “DEI means people DIE,” Elon Musk said after theCalifornia wildfires, criticizing the Los Angeles Fire Department and city and state officials for their efforts to advance diversity in their workforces.\nRelated articleDEI isn’t actually dead\nThe Trump administration hasclamped down on DEIin the federal government, ordering government DEI employees to be placed on leave, ending the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting, and other measures to end DEI practices.\nIn the business world, DEI is typically a mix of recruiting practices, employee training and other measures to boost representation of people of different races, genders, classes, religions and other backgrounds.\nRather than lower hiring standards, supporters say DEI broadens the pool of people employers would consider for a job, in theory finding even more qualified people for tasks than they would have found in the past. Companies that abandon efforts to promote diversity and inclusion risk missing out on the best talent, business leaders say.\n“At its best, DEI is about developing talent, measuring it in a fair way and finding hidden talent and disadvantaged talent in a world where not everybody has an equal chance to exhibit their abilities,” Ken Frazier, the first Black chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company, told CNN in an Octoberinterview.\nDEI initiatives have been shown to boost profits, reduce employee attrition and increase employee motivation, according to Boston Consulting Groupresearchbased on data from more than 27,000 employees in 16 countries.\nAmid growing opposition from right-wing activists, lawsuits from conservative legal groups, demand from conservative-leaning customers and other factors, many high-profile companies have stepped back from some of their DEI pledges. Walmart, McDonald’s, Target, Harley-Davidson, Ford and many others have made changes to their DEI initiatives.\nHowever, most companies remain committed to DEI.\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes DEI,foundin November that 486 of the Fortune 500 companies still have a statement or corporate commitment to DEI on their websites.\nRelated articleCompanies are running away from DEI. One of America’s biggest beauty brands is standing firm\nMost of the changes companies like Walmart and Target have made are “cosmetic” and “inconsequential,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. Companies are adjusting language or repositioning programs rather than abandoning their commitments to expand diversity.\n“Most of the leaders I speak to absolutely see the value [of diversity],” said Tarang Amin, the CEO of e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics company that hasstood behindits DEI programs. “There’s just so much data that says diverse teams perform better than homogeneous teams, that diverse thought really drives better outcomes.”\nBigger companies are standing firmly behind DEI, too.\nCostco recentlyrejecteda proposal brought by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research, that would have required Costco to report on the financial risks of maintaining its diversity and inclusion goals. The group criticized Costco for possible “illegal discrimination” against employees who are “white, Asian, male or straight.”\nCostco said its DEI efforts help the company attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores. Costco also said its members want to interact with a diverse employee base.\n“Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the ‘treasure hunt’ that our customers value,” Costco said in itsproxy statementto investors. Efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion “enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.”"

            "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nIt’s one of the more obviously flawed ideas embraced by both President Donald Trump and his right-hand man Elon Musk: that government should be run like a business.\nSynergies! Streamlining! Above all,efficiency— that is the operative word that will help transform the federal government from a hulking, bloated bureaucracy into a nimble machine, like swapping a 1995 Compaq desktop PC for a 2025 MacBook Pro.\nOf course, Trump and Musk are applying a business playbook to a thing that is decidedlynota business. Governments don’t work for profit, and the services they provide aren’t supposed to wow shareholders or go viral on TikTok. Good government should fade into the background, unnoticed, so that Americans don’t have to think twice about whether it’s safe to get on a commercial flight or drink water from their tap.\nThat’s not to say government agencies are perfectly calibrated. But not all redundancies can be written off as needless red tape. A leading commission on aviation safety, for one, was widely seen as an asset in bringing the sprawling US industry into alignment. Trump disbanded it last week.\nLess than two weeks in, and it’s clear Trump is running the White House with the same dictatorial energy he brought to his companies — almost all of which have been privately held, with no outside board or public shareholders to cater to. It’s a style that also seems to suit Musk, who oversees half a dozen private companies and one public entity, Tesla (where he has stacked his board with loyalists and where he has regularly butted heads with shareholders).\nIn the name of efficiency, the president and Musk are putting on a familiar show of cleaning house — a tactic so clearly modeled after Musk’s past endeavors, theydidn’t even bother to change the subject line.\nOn Day One, the head of theFederal Aviation Administration, who had publicly clashed with Musk over issues related to SpaceX, stepped down. The post remained vacant for nine days. It was only after 67 people were killed in a midair collision over the Potomac River in Washington that Trump announced the appointment of Chris Rocheleau, an FAA veteran who most recently ran an aviation business lobby, to lead the agency.\nOn his second day in office, Trump fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration and Coast Guard, cutting both their terms short.\nRelated articleUS airlines’ 16-year safety record ended with tragedy. There were warnings ahead of the crash\nOn Day Three, all members of a crucial aviation safety committee received a memo,per the AP, saying that the Department of Homeland Security was terminating the group as part of its “commitment to eliminating the misuse of resources and ensuring that DHS activities prioritize our national security.” (The advisory, by the way, was ordered by Congress more than 30 years ago in response to the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, and brought together key groups in the aviation industry to advise the TSA on the most effective safety protocols.)\nDay Seven, trillions in federal fundingwere frozenindefinitely. Day Eight, the US government did a carbon copy of Musk’s Twitter playbook when itemailed 2 million federal workerswith an offer to resign — once again sparking confusion and panic.\nAmong those 2 million workers were some 11,500 air-traffic controllers who have been stretched thin for years, often working overtime and battling burnout. Last year, the FAA said it wasstill short 3,000 controllers, despite a surge in hiring.\nTen days in, and the sturdy bureaucracy — the folks tasked with keeping planes in the air, ensuring water is drinkable, providing housing to veterans, any number of other essential services — is in chaos.\nAnd while the cause of the plane crash, just a few miles from the White House near Reagan National Airport, is not yet known, it is testing the new administration’s response to a crisis at its own doorstep.\nUnsurprisingly, Trump defaulted to a well-worn page of the playbook,heaping blameon his predecessors and suggesting that diversity initiatives eroded aviation standards — a statement that is just not true and, as usual, he offered no evidence. Neither did Vice President JD Vance, or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, or Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who all parroted the boss.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are trying to do their jobs while weighing the offer to simply reply to an email with “resign” and walk away. The offer purports to allow workers to leave with eight months of pay and benefits, though many questioned whether the offer was genuine or even legal.\nThat anguish appears to be part of the plan.\nRuss Vought, Trump’s acting head of theOffice of Management and Budget, has stated plainly in private speechesrevealed by ProPublica last yearthat “we want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.”\n“When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down… We want to put them in trauma.”"

            "text": "A threatened strike at 56 Costco stores across six states has been averted for now, as the company and negotiators for the Teamsters union, representing 18,000 workers, reached an 11th hour tentative agreement, the union told CNN early Saturday morning.\nFull terms of the deal were not immediately available. Costco did not respond a request for comment. The strike would have been the largest ever at an American retail chain, and the first ever at the big box retailer.\nBeyond wages and benefits, the union also had demands regarding seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.\nThe agreement, announced several hours after the contract expired at 11:59pm PT Friday, does not completely end the threat of a strike. It would still need to be ratified by rank-and-file members of the union at Costco before it goes into effect. Last fall, unionized workers at Boeing voted down a tentative deal its union leadership had reached with the aircraft maker and started a strike that lasted two months. But most tentative deals do result in a final contract.\nTeamsters members at Costco make up 8% of its 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers would behave been significant for the largely non-union sector of the economy. Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most of those unionized retail workers work in grocery stores.\nThe specific locations of the unionized stores have not been identified by either the union or company. But the union said they are in six states along the East and West Coasts –  Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia as well as California and Washington state, the latter being Costco’s corporate home. Costco had said on Friday that even if its unionized workers had gone on strike, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intended to use management and non-union staff to keep stores operating.\nAnd even though the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, it was prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of non-union Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remained on the job. Such a move could have greatly increased the economic pressure on the company. While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for other picket lines.\nCostco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains. Its annual company filing states that “our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.”\nCostco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at non-union stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour, to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years. Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20.\nThe Teamsters have pointed to Costco’s strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package. Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a recent union rally held outside Costco’s annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker? Prove it!” and “Record profits = record contract.”\nLast year, the Teamsters staged a five-daystrike at Amazonthat ended the day after Christmas. But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract. Amazon doesn’t even recognize that many of the strikers, who are officially drivers for third-party delivery services despite exclusively delivering packages for the online retailer, are its employees.\nThis is a developing story. It will be updated."

            "text": "US airlines had gone 16 years without a fatal crash until Wednesday night. But as impressive as that safety record had been, there have been warning signs in recent years of a significant risk of acollision like the one that just killed 67 people.\nA regional jet from Wichita, Kansas, operated as an American Airlines flight by feeder carrier PSA Airlines, was preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport when itcollidedwith a US Army Black Hawk helicopter that was crossing its path just a few hundred feet above the ground. The cause of the crash was unknown Thursday as the investigation is just beginning. It was the first fatal crash of a commercial US airplane since 2009.\nAs safe as air travel has become, the US air travel system has been under increasing stress in recent years — with a well-established shortage of the air traffic controllers throughout the nation, despite years of attempting to ramp up hiring. And congestion in many major metropolitan areas, especially around Washington DC, make flying riskier than 16 crash-free years might suggest.\n“I’m saddened, but I’m not surprised,” said Anthony Brickhouse, an aviation safety expert. “In the last two to three years, we’ve had so many close calls with commercial planes having near collisions in and near airport environments. If changes aren’t made, you eventually meet with tragedy.”\nExperts say that while America retains a gold standard for airline safety and that commercial air travel is the safest form of travel, there are stresses on the system that have been apparent in a series of near tragedies in recent years.\nA strained air traffic control system and congestion in the air space over many major cities has squeezed the margins of safety needed to operate the America’s air transportation system, Captain Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines pilot, told CNN early Thursday.\n“You’ve got all the things stacked up against you,” he said. “We’ve got to protect the American public’s trust in the system and prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. The saying goes, ‘You have to investigate accidents before they happen, not after, to get long-term fixes.’ Complacency has no place in our skies today, and we have to make sure we maintain that attitude.”\nThe near collisions, often wrongly referred to by the public as “near misses,” are far more common that most passengers know.\nIn fact just one day before the crash, another regional jet approaching Reagan National airport was forced to abort its first landing and go around after a helicopter flew near its flight path, according to air traffic control audio.\nThat regional jet, inbound from Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, began a climbing right, and told air traffic control, “We had … helicopter traffic below us.” It soon landed safely at the airport. The incident was first reported by theWashington Post.\nThursday CNN found at leasttwo other pilotsin the last three years reported near-collisions with helicopters while landing at Reagan National, according to federal incident reports.\nThe two passenger planes had to take evasive action to avoid colliding with a helicopter when trying to land at the airport, according to reports filed by pilots. In a third incident, two military helicopters got too close together, an air traffic controller reported.\n“It’s unbelievable how much we fly without incident,” said former FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt told CNN. “So when we do have one, it lights up everything.”\nThere have many been other such incidents that are characterized as near collisions by the FAA. One occurred less than three weeks ago in Phoenix when a United Airlines flight from San Francisco carrying 123 passengers and six crew members and a Delta Air Lines flight carrying 245 passengers from Detroit both got clearance to land at virtually the same time, resulting in both receiving warnings they were too close to one another. The aircraft were 1,217 feet — less than a quarter-mile — apart, according to data fromflight-tracking site Flightradar24.\nThe cockpit warning systems that alerted those two planes likely was not able to warn the pilots in the American Airlines flight Wednesday night, because it was only 375 feet above the ground when the Army helicopter was approaching it. Details of what warning the pilots of both aircraft received will be determined in the upcoming crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.\nSome near collisions take place on the ground, not in the air. But they can be just as dangerous, given the speed that planes are traveling on takeoff or landing.\nOn December 27, a charter jet carrying theGonzaga men’s basketball teamnearly crossed a runway at Los Angeles International Airport on which a Delta plane was taking off.\nSome of the near collisions brought two planes even closer to one another. On February 4, 2023, a FedEx jet came within150 feet of the runwaybefore its pilots realized a Southwest jet was taking off on the same runway. It was one offive such incidentsin a period of just seven weeks at the start of last year.\nAnd none of those were potentially asserious as an incident in July 2017, when an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hoursnearly landed on a taxiwayat San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off.\nThe NTSB later determined the Air Canada jet got within 100 feet of the ground before it took off again without making contact with any of the passenger planes on the ground. The safety regulator said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the accident not been averted at the last moment.\n“It would have been the worst disaster in aviation history,” Brickhouse, the aviation safety expert,said. “Pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics — they’re all human, and humans make mistakes. We’ve been working toward designing the system so that when mistakes are made, we can recover from them without it being a tragedy.”\nAnd such near collisions have become so common that the Federal Aviation Administration announced an audit of such incidents last fall.\nAdditionally, there was just one air traffic controller working two different tower positions at the time of the collision Wednesday night, an air traffic control source tells CNN. The source described the set-up, which had one person handling both local and helicopter traffic, as not uncommon.\nThe Reagan National control tower is 85% staffed, the source said, with 24 of 28 positions filled.\nDespite the fact that there is nothing known at this point as to the who was at fault for the crash — air traffic control, the plane’s pilot or the helicopter’s pilot, let alone the qualifications of the people involved in those roles Wednesday night — President Donald Trump, without evidence, blamed the crash on Democrats’ efforts to have a “diversity push” as part of the hiring process at the the FAA’s air traffic control system. Vice President JD Vance echoed that claim.\nAsked at a press conference if he was blaming the air traffic controllers for the crash, or had evidence that they were in that job despite not being qualified, Trumpresponded, “It just could have been.” Asked why he believed diversity hiring efforts played a role in the crash, he responded, “Because I have common sense, OK, and unfortunately, a lot of people don’t.”\nTrump has signed executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs at most of the federal government, including the Transportation Department. But he had not nominated a new head of the FAA until Thursday’s press conference, when he announced that he had picked Chris Rocheleau to lead the nation’s key aviation safety regulator. The previous FAA administrator, Michael Whitaker, left the job the day Trump took office.\nSome airports and air space are under more stress than others. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport hasthe busiest runway in the nation. The airport has seen a number of near collisions in recent years, including an American Airlines flight bound for Boston inMaythat was forced to abort takeoff to avoid another plane that was landing.\nAnd a JetBlue plane and Southwest plane nearlycollided on the runwayof Reagan National Airport in Washington on April 18, when one was cleared for takeoff as the other was directed to cross the runway it was on.\nTight restrictions on where planes can fly is a major issue in Washington DC, with narrow flight paths to avoid areas with high-security needs like the Capitol building and White House. The nation’s capital represents a unique conundrum for flights in the US. Demand is huge at Reagan Washington National thanks to how close it is to downtown Washington. And members of Congress, which controls how many aircraft can use that airport, are often pushing for more direct flights to more destinations.\nCongress approved five additional round trip flights at the airport just last fall. At a press conference at the airport early Thursday, just hours after the crash, Senator Jerry Moran said that he had pushed American to schedule the flight from Wichita to the Washington airport.\n“I know that flight. I’ve flown it many times myself,” said Moran, a Republican from Kansas. “I lobbied American Airlines to begin having a direct nonstop flight service to DCA. That flight has been existence about a year.”\nAt press conferences Thursday morning, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who took office just hours before the crash, said he is convinced that the air traffic system is safe but that the crash is a sign that things need to change.\n“What happened yesterday should not have happened,” he said. “When Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination. That didn’t happen yesterday. That’s not acceptable.”\nCNN’s Alexandra Skores, Pete Muntean, Oren Liebermann, Aaron Cooper, Casey Tolan, Majle de Puy Kamp, Curt Devine, Haley Britzky,Samantha Waldenberg and Donald Judd contributed to this report."

            "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration signed off Thursdayon the first new type of pain reliever to be approved in more than two decades.\nThe drug, suzetrigine, is a 50-milligram prescription pill that’s taken every 12 hours after a larger starter dose. It will be sold under the brand name Journavx.\n“A new non-opioid analgesic therapeutic class for acute pain offers an opportunity to mitigate certain risks associated with using an opioid for pain and provides patients with another treatment option,” Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said ina news release. “This action and the agency’s designations to expedite the drug’s development and review underscore FDA’s commitment to approving safe and effective alternatives to opioids for pain management.”\nRelated articlePurdue Pharma, Sacklers reach $7.4 billion national opioid settlement\nGovernmentsurveysshow that analgesics, or medications that control pain, are the most commonly prescribed type of drug in hospitals.\nAbout 80 million Americans fill prescriptions each year for medications to treat new instances of moderate to severe pain, accordingto a studyby Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the company that developed the new drug; about half those prescriptions are written for opioid medications, which can lead to dependence and addiction.\nSuzetrigine is the first new painkiller approved in the US since Celebrex, a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug called a Cox-2 inhibitor, which was approved in 1998.\nMultiple parts of the body are involved in the sensation of pain, explains Dr. Sergio Bergese, an anesthesiologist at Stony Brook University’s Renaissance School of Medicine. Nerve cells carry an electrical signal from the site of tissue damage up to the brain, which perceives the signal as pain.\nUnlike opioid medications, which dull the sensation of pain in the brain, suzetrigine works by preventing pain-signaling nerves around the body from firing in the first place.\n“This drug, what it is doing is interrupting that path, so even though the tissue injury exists, the brain doesn’t know,” Bergese said.\nAnd crucially, suzetrigine creates no euphoria or high like opioids sometimes can, so doctors believe there’s no potential for it to create addiction or dependence in people who use it.\nThe medication was discovered after researchers learned about a family of fire walkers in Pakistan and discovered that they lacked a gene allowing pain signals to fire in their skin. Members of this family could walk over hot coals without flinching.\nRelated articleBlack patients less likely to receive certain pain relief post-surgery, new research suggests\n“They knew that they were on something hot; they knew they could feel the coals. So it’s not impacting the nerves that do heat and touch and stuff like that. It is just these pain-conducting nerves,” said Stuart Arbuckle, chief operating officer ofVertex Pharmaceuticals. “They were, in every other way, normal.”\nStill, it took scientists 25 years to figure out how to exploit that pain-conducting mechanism to develop a medication.\n“Neurons talk to each other by producing series of nerve impulses, like a Morse code,” said Dr. Stephen Waxman, who directs the Center for Neuroscience and Regeneration Research at the Yale School of Medicine. “And nerve impulses are produced by tiny molecular batteries within the membranes of neurons. The molecular batteries are called sodium channels.”\nSuzetrigine works by closing one sodium channel that conducts only pain signals.\nThere have been many false starts along the way to finding a drug that could block one specific sodium channel. Suzetrigine’s approval means other drugs that could work even better are likely to follow, Waxman said.\n“It is an important step forward, because it provides proof of concept that a [sodium-channel blocker] can reduce pain in humans,” said Waxman, who has no financial ties to the new drug. “That opens up the door to a second generation of even more effective [medications].”\nSuzetrigine is a pill that’s given in two dosages. In studies, participants got an initial dose of 100 milligrams, followed by 50 milligrams every 12 hours.\nDoctors stress that it may not be the right drug for everyone or for every type of pain.\nRelated articleChronic pain is substantially more common in the US than diabetes, depression and high blood pressure, study finds\nIn twoclinical trialsthat included almost 600 participants, suzetrigine controlled pain after abdominal and foot surgeries better than an inactive placebo pill. About as many people said suzetrigine reduced their pain by at least half after surgery as those who took Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and the opioid hydrocodone. The research wasn’t designed to directly compare suzetrigine to Vicodin, however, so it’s hard to know whether one worked better than the other.\nOn a well-known rating scale that runs from 0 to 10, the study participants started with pain of about seven, on average, and suzetrigine reduced it roughly 3.5 points.\n“It’s not like eliminating all pain,” Arbuckle said. “It’s reducing pain by about 50%.”\nIn athird study, of people who had back pain caused by sciatica, suzetrigine reduced pain by about 2 points, the same amount reported by people taking a placebo, suggesting that this drug might not be a standout for chronic pain.\nVertex disagrees, saying that it has tested the drug in different types of chronic pain and that it seems to work for long-term pain, too.  The company is continuing to test it in people who have diabetic neuropathy, in which high blood sugar levels damage nerves over time, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, pain and muscle weakness.\nThe sciatica study was smaller than the others, with about 100 people in the suzetrigine arm and in the placebo group, so there may not have been enough participants to show clear differences between the groups. Placebos tend to have large effects in pain studies too, which complicates their interpretation.\n“In our opinion, the drug did what we expected to do in terms of the amount of pain relief,” Arbuckle said. “But unfortunately, as often happens in studies in pain, there is quite a large placebo response.”\nDoctors who help people manage pain said they were excited to have a new option.\n“The more options we have, the better we’re able to treat each and every patient,” said Dr. Kimberley Mauer, an anesthesiologist at Oregon Health and Science University.\nMauer said cost might be a big factor in how the drug is used. Vertex said that it has set a wholesale cost of $15.50 per 50-mg pill but that patient assistance programs would be available.\nMauer said doctors and patients would have to wait to learn what insurance companies might do in terms of coverage.\n“It might limit some patients getting it. So we just have to kind of see, and it’s hard to tell until it kind of gets out on the market,” she said."

Timely, accurate information is “essential for controlling infections and safeguarding health,” they said in a statement.\n“The removal of HIV- and LGBTQ-related resources from the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies is deeply concerning and creates a dangerous gap in scientific information and data to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the IDSA, and Dr. Colleen Kelley, chair of the HIVMA, said in a statement.\nAs pages started to come down, scholars and activists on social media have encouraged others to archive CDC data.\nIn a letter to Acting HHS Secretary Dr. Dorothy Fink and Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, the Association of Health Care Journalists requested that the sites be restored immediately. The missing datasets are “crucial” for informing the public about issues such as “smoking, vaping, drinking, eating, exercise, and sexual behavior,” the association’s leaders wrote in the letter.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN’s Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report."

            "text": "Winter tends to be peak season for respiratory viruses, and this year is no different in the United States.\nPeople are getting sick with acute respiratory illnesses and visiting health care providers at high levels, according to data from theUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seasonal flu levels are elevated across the country and increasing in many parts, while Covid-19 has also increased in most areas of the country.\nSince many people are dealing with viruses in their households, I wanted to ask a physician what to do. Who should get tested and for which diseases? At what point should people see a health care professional for their symptoms? What over-the-counter treatments are helpful, and which ones are not? And before people get sick, what steps can they take to reduce their risk of contracting these diseases?\nRelated articleSniffling, sneezing, coughing: What infectious disease do you have?\nTo learn more, I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.\nCNN:When should someone who is sick get tested to learn what’s causing their symptoms?\nDr. Leana Wen:Most people with symptoms of respiratory illness do not need be tested. That’s because there arehundreds of virusesthat can cause the common cold, and most healthy people with run-of-the-mill symptoms like a runny nose, congestion and fatigue don’t need testing to identify the type of virus or to distinguish between these viruses from the flu or Covid-19.\nThere are two instances where people should consider testing. The first is if they would qualify for antiviral treatment for Covid-19 or influenza. These are individuals at high risk for developing severe illness from these two viruses, including older individuals and people with significant underlying medical illnesses.\nRelated articleWhen Covid-19 finally got me, here’s what I did next\nFor them, early diagnosis is essential, as antiviral treatment should be started as soon after symptom onset as possible. People can takehome tests, and they can also visit a health care provider to get tested.\nThe second is someone who is very ill. That’s because a patient who is very sick with influenza may be recommended for antiviral treatment, even if they are otherwise generally healthy. Also, a person who has persistent fevers, severe coughing and trouble catching their breath may need additional medical treatment to help stabilize them. They may also not have a virus — or perhaps they had a virus initially, but then they also developed a bacterial infection that may require antibiotics. Such individuals should visit a health care provider, and further testing may be recommended.\nCNN: What are other reasons that people should see a health care professional?\nWen:One is to receive antiviral treatment if someone is in the category of individuals eligible for antivirals. Two is if they have severe or persistent symptoms. I’d add here, too, concerning and unusual symptoms.\nFor instance, while a cough and fever are expected as part of respiratory infections, it is unusual if someone has abdominal pain and starts vomiting. It’s concerning if someone is coughing up blood or develops chest pain. These symptoms should prompt a visit to a health care professional.\nMoreover, people with serious underlying medical conditions should consider contacting their providers early. Someone who has cancer, who has undergone an organ transplant, who has heart failure, who is pregnant or has a young infant — these are all individuals in need of having a plan in advance of getting ill.\nThose individuals for whom viral illnesses can trigger underlying problems should also make a plan with their provider for what to do if they become sick. Some patients with asthma orchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for instance, may preemptively increase their inhaler dose or start using a nebulizing machine if they contract a respiratory virus. Again, these plans should be discussed with their provider, ideally before they fall ill, and certainly as soon as they start having symptoms.\nRelated articleNorovirus cases are surging. A doctor explains what to look for\nCNN: What over-the-counter treatments are helpful? What should be avoided?\nWen:If someone has a fever and body aches, acetaminophen and ibuprofen are effective over-the-counter oral medications that can be taken to reduce these symptoms. They are different medications and can be taken together for maximal effect.\nMake sure to always read the label and follow instructions for use. Children need to use the right doses for their body weight. Adults should also use the right dose, which means not taking too much but also not taking too little. I have seen quite a few patients who claim that these medications do not work but in fact are using a much lower dosage than is appropriate for them.\nFor people with cough and congestion, there are a number of over-the-counter remedies available. For instance, dextromethorphan can suppress coughing, and oxymetazoline and pseudoephedrine can be used to reduce congestion. These products may help some individuals, but they must also be used with caution. Some of these ingredients have significant interactions with other prescription medications. They may also be included with other ingredients, like acetaminophen, and it’s important to make note of the ingredients so that you don’t accidentally take too much of something.\nThe US Food and Drug Administrationadvisesthat children younger than 2 years old do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines. They can, though, use acetaminophen and ibuprofen at the right doses as fever-reducers. Other treatments that can help are humidified air, lots of hydration and, of course, rest.\nRelated articleDoes blowing your nose make cold symptoms worse?\nCNN: Finally, what steps can people take to try to reduce their risk of contracting these diseases?\nWen:Good hand hygiene can reduce the risk of spreading contagious diseases. That means everyone should wash their hands regularly with soap and water, and if this is not available, should use hand sanitizer.\nIndividuals who have a fever and active respiratory symptoms should stay away from others, especially those most vulnerable to severe illness. Vulnerable individuals should also consider taking additional precautions during winter respiratory virus season, including masking in indoor crowded settings."

            "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series.Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\nI confess that like a lot of people, I am guilty of not getting in my steps. After hours at my desk, the thought of changing, driving to the gym and working out is so exhausting that I end up back on my couch binge-watching the latest shows.\nStudies show that10,000 stepsis an arbitrary number — taking as few as2,517 steps dailywas associated with lower mortality rates — but everyone benefits from moving around more. Getting enough movement is a growing issue among Americans.One in 4 adultssit for more than eight hours daily, and nearly half of this group does not exercise.\nRelated article5 secrets to moving better and preventing avoidable injury\nTikTok’slatest fitness trend, the mini stepper, is motivating people like me to get off the couch and move. Fitness influencers are peddling the low-impact cardio workout as an alternative to the gym.\n“The mini stepper is so trendy because it’s a way for people to get movement in without needing to go outside,” said Tami Smith, a personal trainer and founder of Fit Healthy Macros in Florida. “You can hop on a mini stepper and watch TV, killing two birds with one stone.”\nLooking to add more daily movement? Fitness experts agree that the mini stepper is an affordable option — most models range between $30 and $100 and come equipped with resistance bands. With add-ons such as handlebars and nonslip grip mats for greater stability, this easy-to-use device can add variety to any fitness routine.\nMini steppers use two pedals to move up and down in a continuous motion that resembles climbing a flight of stairs. “It’s a hybrid between a stair stepper and an elliptical because it has an elliptical-type gliding motion, but in miniature form,” Smith said. “The compact size makes it an affordable option without taking up too much space in the house.”\nThis gym apparatus primarily targets the lower body along with core muscles, maintaining an upright position while in motion. Tom Hendrickx, a physical therapist and owner of Pivot Physical Therapy in California, said swinging the arms creates a natural walking or running gait that works out the upper body. Most mini steppers also include resistance bands that allow people to activate more of their upper body muscles through bicep curls, arm presses and lateral raises.\nRelated articleAre you stretching correctly? Fitness experts break down what to do pre- and post-workout\nAlong with getting people to move more, Hendrickx said the mini stepper helps cardiovascular health by increasing users’ heart rates. Elevated heart rates strengthen the heart muscle to work harder, pumping blood more efficiently and improving circulation. He added that it also strengthens bones because it is a weight-bearing exercise — joints and muscles support body weight to remain upright against gravity.\nAs for weight loss, Smith said the mini stepper helps burn calories and can catalyze a weight loss journey for a sedentary person. However, she warned that shedding pounds depends on how often people exercise and whether they followa diet with a calorie deficit(eating less calories than you’re burning).\nUsers also may experience mental health benefits. A quick session on the mini stepper can instantly boost mood and energy levels and help with a better night’s sleep, Smith said. Working out will also increase self-esteem.\n“Going from sedentary to moving on the mini stepper will help with a positive self-image as you know that you’re making steps toward improving your health,” she      said.\nRelated articleJust 1,000 more steps a day could reduce your risk of depression, study suggests\nAs with any exercise machine, the mini stepper has some drawbacks. First, the machine requires people to maintain an upright standing position in which they step their feet up and down. With no railings, sustaining this position can be difficult for those with balance issues.\n“For an older adult or someone with coordination issues, a mini stepper is probably not the best tool,” Smith said. “I would rather see these people on an exercise machine where they have the stability of handlebars or something that they could easily grab to ensure they don’t have a misstep and end up getting hurt.”\nRelated articleForget crunches: The smarter way to strengthen your core\nBy design, mini steppers have a short stroke cycle, offering a smaller range of motion than a full-size stair climber. And while a mini stepper increases a person’s daily step count, Hendrickx said those steps may not reflect accurately on a pedometer or an activity tracker.\nThird, the mini stepper is excellent for strengthening leg muscles but doesn’t do as much for glutes, Hendrickx said, noting that full glute activation requires the hip joint to be flexed at a 90-degree angle, similar to sitting down on a chair. Working on a mini stepper provides little squats, with the hips bending at a 15- to 30-degree angle.\n“Unless you’re raising your leg up pretty high, so your thigh is parallel to the floor and pushing all the way back down, you’re not maximizing the activation of the glutes,” he added.\nRelated articleTight hip flexors? This simple move restores mobility in minutes\nIf the goal is to get up and move, Smith and Hendrickx fully support investing in a mini stepper. “Any movement is better than no movement,” Smith added.\nHendrickx recommended using it twice weekly for 10 minutes for someone just starting to engage in physical activity. After several weeks, he said people should challenge themselves to work out three times a week for 15 minutes each session. Eventually, the goal would be to use the mini stepper for 20 to 30 minutes a day.\nJocelyn Solis-Moreira is a New York-based freelance health and science journalist."

            "text": "Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\nBreaking up is hard. Breaking up with someone around Valentine’s Day — a holiday all about love — can seem downright mean. Or is it?\nFebruary is often celebrated as the month of love, yet many couples tend to split around Valentine’s Day, said Kiana Shelton, a therapist at Mindpath Health in Texas.\nValentine’s Day, with its chocolates and roses and romantic dinners, can add a lot of social pressure to show how much you love your partner. Those gestures can feel disingenuous for someone ready to call it quits. It’s also a time when some people are still reflecting on their New Year’s resolutions for self-improvement, which can include a current relationship.\nSo, is it better to break up before Valentine’s Day or buy the flowers and wait for some time until after the holiday has passed? Relationship experts weigh in on when it’s best to break up: before the holiday or afterward.\nBreaking up is usually not a spontaneous decision but rather something people consider for a long time, said Dr. Morgan Cope, an assistant professor of psychology at Centre College in Kentucky, who conducts research on the intersection of the self and romantic relationships.\nWhile dumping your partner before the holiday appears heartless, she said there will never be a good time to end the relationship except now. There will always be another holiday, birthday and other excuses to prolong a relationship that has run its course.\nRelated articleThese tips might help you ‘unbreak’ your heart after losing someone\nSpending Valentine’s Day with someone you do  not have romantic feelings for can also be mentally distressing.\n“Imagine picking out a gift or going out to dinner when you don’t want to be there, being physically intimate with your partner you don’t want to be with,” Cope said. “Breakups are always going to be difficult, but you don’t have to make it any harder on yourself or your partner by forcing something that isn’t meant to be.”\nSocial media also has made Valentine’s Day a performative spectacle, creating a “breeding ground for comparison and false perceptions about what it means to show up for the people we love,” Shelton said.\nThere is immense pressure for public displays of affection, such as buying jewelry or wrapping a bouquet of roses with money, to compete with what others are posting about their partner, she noted. Expectations for luxury gifts and expensive dinners may have people reevaluating whether it’s worth spending time and money on a new relationship or one that is not going anywhere.\nBy breaking up before Valentine’s Day, Cope said people are free from planning a romantic evening that feels forced and insincere. “You want to be truthful and authentic to your partner, which means not investing emotional and financial resources into a big celebration,” Cope said. She argued that breaking up might surprise your partner because celebrating the holiday may make people believe the relationship is more secure than it is, leading to confusion and possible resentment.\nCope advised giving yourself at least a week before the holiday      to end the relationship. While it will still be a tough conversation, it gives each person time to process the breakup and make alternative plans for Valentine’s Day with friends and family.\nRelated articleThe bright side of divorce, according to experts\nNow if you’re still on the fence about ending the relationship, Shelton advised waiting until after the holidays. Without the holiday fanfare, she said people have a clearer mindset to process their emotions, including whether the pressure of making a grand declaration of love was what left them uncertain about the relationship’s future.\nWaiting until after the holiday also can give people one last chance to show that the relationship is worth continuing. Shelton said that seeing a partner go above and beyond on Valentine’s Day may address doubts and make people more willing to work through their issues rather than end the relationship.\nLastly, some people might break up after Valentine’s Day to avoid creating a mental association between the holiday and a breakup. Shelton explained that our brains tend to create patterns and find meaning between two events. An annual reminder of the breakup can make it seem like your relationships never makes it beyond Valentine’s Day. “Breaking up not so close to the holiday will avoid making this false association,” she said.\nRelated articleThe ideal couple configuration, according to an expert\nGuilt is a normal and common feeling when breaking up with someone. “Guilt is a social emotion we feel when we’re around other people or thinking about what other people think of us,” Cope said. While the moment hurts right now, she advised reminding yourself that you are considerate enough not to waste your partner’s time by misleading them with holiday celebrations, which can imply that the relationship is strong.\nShelton said one of the ways to move through discomfort is to acknowledge the timing. “An example is saying that I know it’s close to Valentine’s Day, but that it’s important to express what I am feeling without being pressured to perform around this day,” she said. Being direct yet compassionate will evoke many emotions but using “I” statements to express feelings without playing the blame game will better explain the reason behind this difficult decision.\nRelated articleA strong relationship needs both partners to respond to each other’s ‘bids for connection.’ Here’s what that means\nEnding with kindness can make any difficult  situation more bearable. Shelton said it helps to express gratitude for the  time shared when the relationship was meaningful.\n“If we’re focusing on the discomfort from breaking up, we’ll continue to feel shame and guilt,” she said. “Focusing on the growth and lessons learned will help each other move forward in future relationships.”\nJocelyn Solis-Moreira is a New York-based   freelance health and science journalist."

            "tags": "",
            "text": "Editor’s Note:Channon Hodge is a video producer at CNN, overseeing digital video content for Travel and Wellness.\nI understand the benefits of making New Year’s resolutions. I’ve seen the brain science on how to make them work. The idea of slicing and dicing goals into micro-atomic resolutions that will make life so much better all sounds lovely.\nI just can’t do it.\nI’m a news producer coming out of a year filled with one horrific global event after another. I’m also a single mom by choice of a 20-month-old. I adore him but I barely made it to 2025. I’m not sure I’ll make it to 2026.\nThat’s why I’ve made no plans to try harder, set an intention or try to improve on anything.\nWhat I did do, however, was revisit some of the six months of company-sponsored therapy I tried in 2024 to figure out why I’m so enraged by my friends’ well-intentioned New Year’s Instagram posts. I also did some research, called up a psychologist and queried my discussion groups of single moms.\nThen it was Niecy Nash-Betts and Snoop Dogg to the rescue. Their speeches after being honored for their work popped up as viral videos on my social media feeds, giving me the words I needed to tie all that advice together.\nI started searching online to learn more about my lack of motivation, and I found a theory called the “progress principle.” It came from researchers who poured through more than 12,000 diary entries from over 200 people working at several chosen companies.\nIn 2007, researchers Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer found that what separated a worker’s good day from a bad one was whether that day containedprogress or setbacks. (Amabileis now the Edsel Bryant Ford Professor of Business Administration, Emerita, at Harvard Business School, and Kramer is an independent researcher and writer.)\nGood days contained some sort of minorbut meaningful step forward in completing a project. A setback proved to be demotivating, and multiple setbacks led to burnout. This simple and somewhat rational finding became the foundation of the book “The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy, Engagement, and Creativity at Work” by Amabile and Kramer and an important thread in the study of productivity and motivation in the workplace.\nClinical psychologist Melanie McNally also touched on the importance of recognizing progress when she wrote about a high-achieving but frustrated client. McNally’s article in Psychology Today spoke to me about my yearslong lull, so I called her up to learn more.\n“So often what people do is they’re just constantly moving the goalposts, just moving on to the next thing,” McNally told CNN. “And that’s not helpful. That’s what leads to burnout.”\nI realized this theory doesn’t just describe work. It describes parenthood.\nWhen my son finally stopped waking up three times a night for feedings, he suddenly stopped taking a bottle (which meant I could never leave his side). Ugh.\nWhen he finally started taking a bottle again a few months later, he refused to try solids other than applesauce. When he started trying solids, he regressed on sleep training. I spent 18 months moving from one goalpost to another, feeling the entire time like I was nearly failing as a mom.\nMy parenting chat groups are full of these dominoing challenges, none more vivid in my recent chats than that faced by Melissa Carter, also a single mom by choice. Her toddler spent days in the intensive care unit for respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV, and pneumonia.\nFor parents who are couples, hospitalization for your child is devastating. For a single parent, it is also lonely and completely destabilizing. It leads some single parents to question whether they can manage at all.\nMelissa was the first to answer my query asking if anyone was making resolutions. Yes, she told me, sort of. She’s thought about this “moment of beginning” a lot, and as an adjunct assistant professor of public service and senior director forGlobal Spiritual Lifeat New York University, she’s developed a resilience I admire. She doesn’t care for resolutions either.\nInstead, she focuses on one word for the year. Last year’s word was “alignment.” It helped her think about staying true to who she was, which she has discovered can be two different people when it comes to parenting her son, Sage.\n“Sage’s mom is a bad ass,” she told me. “She was like a pit bull in that hospital. You know? And then there’s Melissa, that is also quite amazing, successful, and has her own wounds and her own history that she also has to work through.”\nThe application of progress theory to parenthood makes sense, McNally told me. It’s also a connection therapists have made to help all sorts of struggling clients reinforce positivity. Half of McNally’s clients are teenagers and, by extension, their parents are included. She holds parent group meetings and starts each one by asking everyone to share a small win, a moment of progress, for a key reason:\nTo profit from progress, Amabile and Kramer’s research and other findings that followed realized that small wins must be celebrated. Big wins are rare, these advocates said, but celebrating a small one can be a powerful catalyst for the brain and for self-esteem.\nIf you’re just moving from one challenge to the next, the brain associates achievement with stress, which, over the long term, can lead to burnout, McNally said. She added that instead, you want the brain toconnect achievement to pleasure. Celebration gets you a little hit of dopamine and then comes the bigger benefit.\n“Your brain gets to really feel what you’ve done and what you’ve achieved,” McNally said. “You make that direct connection between the reward and the achievement. So now when you go on to the next thing, it’s almost like you have some closure because you’ve celebrated this thing.”\nI started to think that I inadvertently missed out on a whole lot of celebration. And look, throughout the year, people told me I was a great mom, but it felt strange to hear and I didn’t know why.\nSo what was wrong? McNally said these accolades can sometimes feel too generic and that can then feel disingenuous, even when they’re kindly meant. In acknowledging progress or wins, specificity and evenmaterial rewardscan help. So buying myself two croissants the morning after my son slept through the night after a week of nightly wakeups was right for me. (But there are not enough croissants in all of Brooklyn for the year I’ve had.)\nSo here comes Niecy Nash-Betts. After decades acting in movies, hosting one of my favorite reality shows, “Clean House,” and creating a deadpan yet hilarious cop on “Reno 911!,” Nash-Betts finally won an Emmy in 2024 for a dramatic role. On stage, she thanked God, Netflix, the voters and then added:\n“I want to thank me for believing in me and doing what they say I could not do! And I want to say to myself, in front of all of you beautiful people, go on, girl, with your bad self,”said Nash-Betts, who won the best supporting actress award in a limited or anthology series or movie for “Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.”\nShe later told“Entertainment Tonight”she had to push hard to get the industry to realize she was more than just funny.\n“It’s not called mamma-esteem and us-esteem and them-esteem,” she said while holding her Emmy that night. “It’s called self-esteem because done nobody gotta believe it but you.”\nShe wasn’t the first to go viral for thanking herself.Snoop Doggdid the same in 2018 when he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nWhat Snoop Dogg and Nash-Betts led me to believe is that it shouldn’t be unorthodox to acknowledge your own accomplishments. In doing so, you can believe in yourself without waiting for others to believe in you, too.\nSaying thank you was the least I could do for a mom who tried really, really hard. My “one word” — thanks — is a small way to celebrate a year of wins. I could add some croissants for good measure. I told McNally, the clinical psychologist, that I was going to spend some time in 2025 acknowledging my progress over the past year.\nShe told me that was a good idea, adding, in a way only a therapist can, that it might help me approach challenges differently this year. That sounds like a resolution. She told me to go for it but to be specific and write it down.\nSo, for the first time in the four decades that I’ve spent writing journals, essays and stories, I start to write it out.\nChannon, I want to thank you.\nThank you for trying to scoop up all that water using a dishpan when it started flooding your garden apartment.\nThank you for giving up your garden and moving somewhere new with a toddler in tow.\nThank you for spending six months carrying your breast pump, your laptop, your measly collection of milk, your container of cafeteria food that would turn into your dinner and your 15-pound child up two flights of stairs into your new apartment all those days you had to go to the office.\nThank you for eventually thinking of those two flights of stairs as your gym substitute and then still joining a gym because the one-month free promo got to you.\nThank you for crying when you needed to, even that one time in Bryant Park after your eye doctor’s receptionist snickered because you’d missed an important appointment while trying to get to a funeral you also missed, but you’re doing amazing and the sobs came, and those two teenage girls in the park were glaring at you and you didn’t give them the finger.\nLike, that specific? Yes."

One of them addressed the death ofFloyd, who died in 2020 after an encounter with police in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n“Honestly, I think that very few people ever cared about George Floyd, a drug addict swindler, but his death has served to once again demonstrate that there are people who still consider Black people to be … without rights and consider policemen to be assassins,” she posted. “They’re all wrong.”\nThe actress also posted critically about the 2021 Academy Awards, held after the Covid-19 pandemic had disrupted Hollywood and much of the world.\n“More and more the #Oscars are looking like a ceremony for independent and protest films, I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M,” Gascón wrote. “Apart from that, an ugly, ugly gala.”\nShe also posted about Islam and the Muslim community.\n“Islam is becoming a hotbed of infection for humanity that urgently needs to be cured,” she wrotein a post from 2016.\nGascón was nominated for best actress for her performance in the Netflix musical/crime drama about a drug lord seeking gender reassignment surgery."

            "text": "Justin Baldoni’s lawyer has launched a public website containing documents pertaining to the actor and director’s legal battle with actress Blake Lively.\nThewebsiteposted on Saturday, two days ahead of the first court hearing in the highly publicized case, which is set for Monday.\nBaldoni and Lively, who costarred in the 2024 film “It Ends With Us,” have been sparring over Lively’s accusations of sexual harassment against Baldoni on the project and subsequent professional retaliation. Baldoni has denied Lively’s allegations, claiming that she and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, actually sought to destroy his career after hijacking the creative direction of his film.\nSo far, the website contains two public documents, which have already been filed in court: Baldoni’s amended $400 million complaint against Lively and Reynolds, plus a 168-page “timeline of relevant events,” which was filed as an additional exhibit to Baldoni’s amended complaint.\n“The decision to amend our lawsuit was a logical next step due to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light,” Freedman told CNN in a statement on Saturday.\nCNN has also reached out to representatives for Lively and Reynolds regarding the website.\nBaldoni’s team has claimed they have “nothing to hide.”\nLast month, Baldoni’s representativesshared footagefrom a scene filmed for “It Ends With Us,” which they said refuted some of Lively’s claims. Her lawyers, however, said “every frame of the released footage corroborates, to the letter, what Ms. Lively described in Paragraph 48 of her Complaint.”\nLively’s team has requested media restrictions against Freedman to “ensure the proceedings in this court are not prejudiced by counsel’s conduct outside of the courtroom,” her attorneys wrote in a letter to the judge last month. They have also indicated they will seek to dismiss Baldoni’s case against them altogether.\nOn Monday, lawyers on both sides are due in New York court for a hearing in the case. Neither Baldoni nor Lively are expected to be present, a source with knowledge of the planned proceeding told CNN.\nThe trial has been set for March of 2026.\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

The former late night host also serves as an executive producer for the program.\nIn true Grammys fashion, a starry lineup of performers are slated to appear during the telecast, including Benson Boone, Billie Eilish,Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, Doechii, Raye, Sabrina Carpenter, Shakira and Teddy Swims.\nBrad Paisley, Brittany Howard, Coldplay’s Chris Martin, Cynthia Erivo, Herbie Hancock, Jacob Collier, Janelle Monáe, John Legend, Lainey Wilson, Sheryl Crow, St. Vincent and Stevie Wonder are also set to take the Grammys stage on Sunday.\nThere will also be a performance from several artists honoring the life and legacy of of the lateQuincy Jones, plus musical tributes to honor Los Angeles following the devastating wildfires.\nThe biggest question going into the ceremony is whether this will finally be Beyoncé’s year to win the prestigious album of the year award for her genre-defying album “Cowboy Carter.” The singer is the most awarded Grammy-winner in history but has yet to score a win for album of the year, the show’s biggest award.\nThe AOTY category itself is jam-packed, with Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Charli XCX, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, André 3000 and Jacob Collier all nominated for the top prize.

            "text": "Bey-lieve it or not: The 2025 album of the year category might be the most high stakesGrammysrace in years.\nBut let’s back up.\nThe category has a little something for everyone this year – from the pink-drenched newcomer Chappell Roan’s velvety vocals in her debut album “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” to André 3000’s flute-centric “New Blue Sun.”\n“It’s a phenomenal slate of nominees. It’s jam packed. I think it can hold its own with any year in history in terms of the albums that are going up against each other,” Rolling Stone senior writer, critic and author Rob Sheffield told CNN. “It’s an all-time slate of classic albums all happening at the same time.”\nBut Beyoncé’s genre-bending smash“Cowboy Carter”in particular is the one album out of the versatile crop of nominees that seems to hold the highest stakes – not for the artist herself, but for the Grammys.\nThe Recording Academy has consistently overlooked Beyoncé in this specific category, with the singer losing four times for her albums “Renaissance” (2023), “Lemonade” (2017), “Beyoncé” (2015) and “I Am… Sasha Fierce (2010).\nFor the most part, Beyoncé has remained unfazed. She even referred to her unsuccessful bids in the category on the “Cowboy Carter” song“Sweet Honey Buckin,”singing in part that she takes the losses “on the chin.”\nWhile Beyoncé has seemingly accepted her losses with a gracious smile, each time showing the utmost respect for the winner, her husband Jay-Z – and her millions of supporters known as the Beyhive – have been more vocal,calling out the Recording Academy, the group behind the Grammys, for overlooking an artist that is widely considered to be one of the most influential of our time.\n“She knows she’s an artist who knows that the art itself is the legacy,” Sheffield said. “I think she cares about making these genius records one after another… But there’s a sense that for this particular Grammy category to matter, Beyoncé has to win it.”\nThe album of the year category is regarded as the top prize of the Grammys, akin to the esteemed best picture category at the Oscars. It’s part of what’s become known as “the big four” categories, which includes best new artist, record of the year and song of the year.\nDespite the losses for album of the year, Beyoncé haswon more Grammysthan any other artist in history, earning 32 statues from a whopping 99 nominations.\nInstances where supporters feel Beyoncé was egregiously overlooked have fueled the fervor for her to win at this year’s ceremony. Sheffield points to Beyoncé’s loss to Beck’s “Morning Phase” in 2015 as a moment that “seemed like the biggest upset in Grammy history at that point.” Ever since then, he said, the Grammy’s album of the year race has always been about whether Beyoncé is winning the category.\n“Everything else has become a sideshow,” Sheffield added.\nAdele’s win of the prestigious award for her album “21” at the 2017 Grammys further fanned the flames of agitation. Adele made certain to acknowledge the significance of “Lemonade” during heracceptance speech.\n“I can’t possibly accept this award,” she tearfully said, addressing Beyoncé directly. “I love you and I always have and I always will.”\nIn many ways, “Lemonade” got the last laugh. The album sits atop many “best of” lists, including claiming the No. 1 spot on Rolling Stone’s“250 greatest albums of the 21st century so far”list, published earlier this month. Lauded for its cultural resonance and visual storytelling, it’s widely consideredtheBeyoncé album for the ages.\nBut according to music, pop culture and politics writer and journalist Taylor Crumpton, “Cowboy Carter” has, too, carved out its own unique place in the cultural zeitgeist, making it just as deserving of an album of the year win as “Lemonade.”\n“I think they both changed culture,” Crumpton told CNN. “I think ‘Lemonade’ opened up an opportunity for us to talk about Black feminism in pop culture, and I think ‘Cowboy Carter’ opened up an opportunity for us to talk about the hidden history – and the often erased history – of Black Americans in Western history in the United States.”\nWith so many Grammy wins and a legacy as one of the most influential artists of our time, Beyoncé might not be sweating an album of the year win quite as much as perhaps the Grammys as an organization may be.\nBeyoncé supporters, including her husband rapper Jay-Z, have long taken issue with the consistency in which Beyoncé has been overlooked in the album of the year category.\nWhile accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award during the 2024 ceremony, Jay-Z called out the Recording Academy after Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” album lost album of the year to Harry Styles’ “Harry’s House” in 2023.\nThe Recording Academy has also faced criticism for failing to equally recognize women and artists of color, along with alienating rap and hip-hop performers in key categories, over the years. The group in 2020announcedchanges they’re implementing to address that.\nWhile six of the eight nominees in this year’s album of the year category are women, female artists are still underrepresented at the Grammy Awards, according to a recently released report by AKAS (Addy Kassova Audience Strategy Ltd), with research and analysis funded by the Gates Foundation. In the last eight years, only 1 in 5 nominations and wins have gone to women, the report read.\nThis year, André 3000 and indie-jazz artist Jacob Collier are the sole male nominees for album of the year. Taylor Swift’s“The Tortured Poets Department,”Sabrina Carpenter’s “Short ‘n Sweet,” Charli XCX’s dancefloor-centric “Brat” and Billie Eilish’s “Hit Me Hard and Soft” are also nominated.\n“If Beyoncé does not win, I believe the response will be varied upon racial demographics, gender demographics, about who was deserving and worthy of this award, and what does that signify for every artist who will enter the music industry,” Crumpton said.\nThrough her music, Beyoncé “has intertwined herself with the history of Black Americans in the United States,” so another loss in this category, Crumpton added, will be felt “by all Black artists of the diaspora who look towards the United States and institutions like the Grammys, like Billboard, to validate them and open up other doors.”\nThe Grammys will be handed out Sunday from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. It will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+ at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.\nCNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report."

            "text": "While a lot has been said about thefriendship between Robin Williams and Christopher Reeve, the famed pair’s bond illustrates a very basic and instrumental type of kindness, according to Reeve’s daughter.\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Alexandra Reeve discussed the documentary “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story” – which airs on CNN this weekend – and elaborated on the late actors’ friendship, which she likened to “more of a brotherhood.”\n“Super/Man” explores her father’s life and career both before and after the 1995 horse riding accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down and hislegacy of advocacyfor people living with spinal cord injuries. The film highlights how Williams – the legendary and improvisational funnyman who died in 2014 – was the first person to get Reeve to laugh in the hospital after his fall, by dressing up in scrubs and pretending to be a Russian proctologist.\n“Their relationship really showed what it is to be a friend for someone, what it is to show up for the important people in your life through thick and thin,” Reeve reflected.\nAlexandra Reeve pointed out, however, that it is not necessary to be a comedian on par with Williams to help someone in challenge smile, or be there for them.\n“You don’t have to move heaven and earth, but sometimes showing up for a friend just through a phone call, remembering to write, remembering to show up and celebrate what could be a dark day and help turn it into a light day,” she explained. “Robin was such a beautiful example of that and it’s a legacy that continues to today.”\nShe described how Williams, who first met Reeve when they were both studying acting at Juilliard in New York City, continued showing up for her father and her family prior to Reeve’s death in 2004.\n“Throughout the 10 years after my dad’s accident, they were there for us emotionally, continuing to celebrate the anniversary of dad’s accident every year, his ‘life day,’ his survival day, and focus on the positive side of that,” she said, adding that Robin and his second wife, Marsha Williams, made a point of “continuing to remind dad and Dana (Reeve, Christopher Reeve’s widow who died in 2006) who they were.”\nAlexandra Reeve shared that the two families remain intimately connected to this day.\n“Oftentimes after a friend goes through a traumatic event, you can – and I think many people will relate to this – you can kind of pull back, because you don’t want to bother them. But Robin and Marsha did the opposite. They showed up even more than before and would call just to shoot the breeze and have normal conversations,” she recalled. “And it’s amazing how easy it is to take that for granted. But often when you’re going through hardship, that’s actually what you want – is a friend that continues to treat you in the same way, and connect with you, and remind you of your old self.”\n“Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story” airs on CNN on Sunday, February 2, at 8pm ET/PT.  It’s presented by CNN Films, HBO Documentary Films and DC Studios, which like CNN are owned by Warner Bros. Discovery."

            "tags": "",
            "text": "A few weeks ago, as prep on theGrammy Awardswas getting underway, tragedy hit Los Angeles.\nThe heart of music industry was ravaged by fires, burning down the homes of thousands of people who remain displaced across Southern California.\nJust two days before the fires, Hollywood was in celebration mode, kicking off award season in Beverly Hills at the Golden Globes. But with fires spreading unfathomable destruction,calls to cancelthe Grammys, SAG Awards and Oscars came quickly.\nBut for Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. and the executive producer of the Grammy Awards Ben Winston, there was no other option. The show would go on.\n“We know we’ve got the biggest stars in the whole world that are sitting there, and we bring real awareness to what’s happened. We do some really serious fundraising for the causes that need it so much right now. We pay tribute to our first responders. We showcase LA businesses. Surely that is worth doing rather than not doing,” Winston, who calls LA home, told CNN in an interview this week.\n“Some of our community, from the music community, have lost their homes. They’ve lost their instruments,” added Mason Jr. “I know one guy that lost his entire studio. All his collections, all his instruments, and this is how they make a living. So, if we were to postpone the show, we wouldn’t be able to raise the money that we need to support those people.”\nSpeaking with CNN at the Crypto.com arena in the center of the city, amid a brief break in construction of the stage for Sunday’s event, Mason Jr. and Winston acknowledged that they have a difficult task in striking the right tone at the ceremony.\nRelated articleAll artists performing at the Grammys so far\n“Grammys and this platform is cool, but it’s not the most important thing in the world,” said Mason Jr. “Some people have lost their lives here.”\nWith returning host Trevor Noah, the duo feels they have the right emcee to guide a show that aims to celebrate music and a population of people working to recover.\n“Before this happened, I probably knew the name of four of my neighbors. I reckon I now know about 23 of them. There is a sense of community right now in Los Angeles that I personally haven’t seen before, where people are helping each other,” Winston said. “There is a real different sense of what’s happening here, and I think we can reflect that on the show.”\nMason Jr. points out that music has the power to heal and bring people together. The broadcast, he said, will include components of showcasing first responders and raising money for those in need.\n“We’re definitely going to honor music, celebrate excellence in the year,” Mason Jr. said. “There’ll be incredible performances, but there’s also going to be a layer of emotion and heart and storytelling about the heroes.”\nAlready, the Recording Academy and its charitable arm, MusiCares, have distributed more than $4 million in emergency aid to individuals within the music industry who have been affected by the wildfires.\nBy continuing on with the Grammys, Winston pointed out that the show is also keeping people employed at a critical time.\nAftercontinuous production shutdownsfrom the pandemic, the Hollywood strikes and the fires, many in the industry have had a difficult five years. According to Winston, 6,500 people from a range of trades work on the Grammys telecast.\nWinston and Mason Jr. promise that the Grammys will still be the Grammys. In other words, the format is not shifting to a full telethon, but there will be moments of recognition like a special performance by Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, the Recording Academy announced on Friday.\nTop Grammy nominees this year include Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx, Sabrina Carpenter and Kendrick Lamar, ensuring that the show will be stacked with starpower.\nAll eyes will be on Beyoncé, who comes in with the most nominations of the night and has already made history as the most nominated artist in Grammy history. But the superstar has yet to winalbum of the year. With 11 nominations from her genre-bending album, “Cowboy Carter,” will this be the year?\n“I’m going to give you a hot take,” Mason Jr. said with a tinge of sarcasm. “I feel like she’s got a one in eight chance of winning that thing. I’m serious!”"

            "text": "Joan Collinsis to playWallis Simpsonin a biopic about the American socialite whose relationship with the British King led to his abdication.\nThe 91-year-old actress revealed that the cameras will soon start rolling for the film, entitled “The Bitter End.”\nShe posted a split panel of two black and white images onInstagramof herself and Simpson, who became the Duchess of Windsor after she married King Edward VIII following his abdication.\nCollins said: “I’m delighted to be playing #wallissimpson the #duchessofwindsor in an untold story about her final years, to start shooting soon in London and Paris.”\nThe news was greeted with much excitement from Collins’ Instagram followers. One wrote: “This is going to be great – I’ve always been so curious about those final years for her.”\nAnother said: “This will be extraordinary! And no one could play the role more exquisitely than you @joancollinsdbe ! Just phenomenal!”\nFilming is set to begin in May of this year, when the actress, who famously played the scheming Alexis Colby in ’80s soap “Dynasty,” turns 92.\nEdward VIII scandalized British society in 1936 when he stepped away from the throne in order to marry Simpson, an American divorcée.\nSimpson was born Bessie Wallis Warfield in Pennsylvania in 1896. She lived in London in the 1930s with her second husband, Ernest Simpson. It was during this period that she met the prince, who became King on the death of his father, George V, in 1936.\nEdward abdicated after just 10 months on the throne, sparking a constitutional crisis that led to the coronation of his younger brother, George VI – father of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\nEdward and Wallis, who went on to be known as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, were married in France in 1937, and spent most of the rest of their lives there. In 1953, they moved into Villa Windsor, a 14-room mansion, in the Boulogne woods of western Paris. The duke died in 1972, while his wife continued to live there in increasing isolation and declining health until her death in 1986.\nThe film promises to tell “the shocking untold story of the last years of Wallis Simpson,” according to production firm John Gore Studios.\nCurrently in pre-production, the film’s script has been written by Louise Fennell, the mother of actress and screenwriter Emerald Fennell, who played Camilla Parker Bowles in Netflix’s “The Crown.”\n“The Bitter End” is set to be directed by Mike Newell, whose previous credits include “Four Weddings and a Funeral” and “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.”\nCNN royal commentator Kate Williams contributed to this article."

But, Crystal said, “It will be ok. With your help around the country and here in the room, we’ll laugh again. We’re going to listen to music again and we will be ok.”\nSamuel L. Jackson welcomed the crowd at the Intuit Dome once that concert got going, energetically thanking the first responders who were in the audience for the show. “We love our firefighters and we need to help them right now,” he said. Jackson then introduced Sir Rod Stewart, who started his set with his hit “Forever Young.”\nPink sang a pared down acoustic set including a cover of Janis Joplin’s gritty 1971 hit “Me and Bobby McGee,” a cover of Led Zeppelin’s “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You” and her song “What About Us.” Later, Slash made a surprise cameo, joining the Black Crowes to perform a Led Zeppelin cover of “Going to California.”\nLater in the show, Stevie Nicks shared a story during her set about how she nearly lost her Pacific Palisades home, which she said was made of wood and built in 1938. “She stands strong,” Nicks said of her house that was saved because of the Santa Rosa firefighters who she said “never gave up.” Nicks dedicated “Landslide” to those first responsders.\nThere was also a major Nirvana moment when indie rocker St. Vincent made a surprise appearance to cover the epic ’90s grunge band’s “Breed” with the band’s original members Dave Grohl on the drums and bassist Krist Novoselic. Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon as well as Joan Jett came out to cover other Nirvana songs, with Grohl’s daughter Violet coming on stage to cap off the swirling set with “All Apologies.”\nThe shows raised money “for rebuilding communities devastated by wildfires and supporting efforts to prevent future fire disasters throughout Southern California,” according to a news release.\nAmong theartistswho performed at the concerts are native Angelenos Eilish, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Gracie Abrams.\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers took the stage at the Kia Forum, along with Alanis Morissette, No Doubt, Joni Mitchell, Stephen Stills and John Mayer. Dr. Dre and Sheila E. were surprise performers who took the stage alongside Anderson. Paak.\nThe second concert’s lineup was also packed, with Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Earth, Wind & Fire, Jelly Roll, Lil Baby, Olivia Rodrigo, Peso Pluma, Sting, Tate McRae and Stevie Wonder.\nThe pop queens rocked toward the end of the show with Perry, of course, singing her 2010 classic “California Gurls” while twirling around on stage with a California flag. Eilish performed three acoustic songs and spoke about her hometown, saying that Los Angeles is her “favorite place in the world.” Gaga closed out the show with two songs from the “A Star is Born” soundtrack, and ended with a new song that she said she wrote with herfiancé Michael Polanksyjust for FireAid.\nRelated articleHow to make the most of your donation to LA wildfire victims\nViewers around the world were able to watch, stream and make contributions to FireAid on platforms including Apple Music, Apple TV, Max, Peacock, KTLA+, Netflix/Tudum, Paramount+, Prime Video and more, beginning at 6 p.m. PT/ 9 p.m. ET on Thursday.

This eight-part guide will have you packing your bags in no time.\nNot all publicity is good publicity. Especially when it leads to 10,000 daytrippers invading a ski resort, chaotic scenes on the slopes, extreme traffic snarl-ups, accusations of bad behavior and emergency crowd control measures.\nThat’s what happened at Roccaraso, one of Italy’s most popular skiing destinations, on Sunday after viral influencer posts on social media about bumper snowfalls prompted tour companies in the coastal city of Naples to organize cheap tour buses for bored residents to enjoy an outing in the mountains.\nCue the invasion, with 220 tour buses making the two-hour, 130-kilometer (78-mile) trip, alongside cars full of curious day visitors, blocking the resort’s narrow roads and angering its 1,500 local residents.\nThe tour groups — who paid $20 for the trip, including a sandwich — are accused of causing mayhem on the slopes by ignoring ski etiquette or sliding down on improvised sleds made from, among other items, saucepans.\nThere were also complaints after some visitors were seen insocial media videoslighting barbecues for warmth or to cook food. Others were accused of leaving trash.\nSunday’s events prompted municipalities around Roccaraso, located in central Italy’s Abruzzo region, to introduce crowd-control measures, including limiting tour bus access to the area.\nLocal media credit — or blame — Rita De Crescenzo, apopular influencer from Naples, who has posted a series of videos on TikTok and other social media platforms in recent weeks inviting people to experience the snow.\nCapitalizing on the popularity of her posts, several budget tour companies and organizers then started offering the deals, some even quoting her.\nRelated articleItaly bans Airbnb self-check-ins\nDe Cresenzo responded in acolorful post Wednesday, saying it wasn’t her fault that buses had blocked the roads. “I made such a beautiful advertisement for Roccaraso where I was on Monday and Tuesday and the crowd went crazy because I put up wonderful videos,” she said in the post.\nRoccaraso’s mayor, Francesco di Donato, told CNN that the unauthorized tour buses were “a real assault” on the area, which made the situation “hellish” for many, especially those who have homes around the resort or who have season passes.\nHe said that on a normal two-day winter weekend, the area normally saw about 20,000 skiers and a further 15,000 who sled and trek. The 10,000 additional tourists on Sunday alone created a security risk for the whole area.\nConcerned about reports from tourism bodies that twice the number of day trip deals have been booked for this coming Sunday, February 2, he has summoned the prefecture of the regional capital L’Aquila to ensure proper traffic police and security forces.\nFrancesco Emilio Borrelli, a Green Party politician from Naples, posted a lengthyFacebook videoin which he scolded the day-trippers and tour organizers.\n“Go to Roccaraso for 15 euros without a receipt? Throw your garbage in the snow? What are we talking about?” he said. “People who have passes and follow the rules were made to wait three hours in their cars for these people who didn’t have permission or passes to be there. Not in my name as a Neapolitan.”\nSome of the day-trippers shot back on social media, accusing the locals of discrimination because they are from Naples. Roccaraso’s mayor denied their city of origin had anything to do with objections.\n“Roccaraso welcomes and wants to welcome more and more tourists, but civil and correct skiers,” he said. “The Roccaraso system is unable to contain the assault of those who come only on Sundays. We cannot put a thousand chemical bathrooms in a ski resort.\n“I am on the street, these people do not have patience, they get nervous, they don’tgive a damn about the machines that come. Sooner or later you risk the accident. I say it firmly: they have to face this phenomenon as if it were a soccer match.”"

            "text": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)— A mountain inNew Zealandconsidered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being.\nMount Taranaki — now known as Taranaki Maunga, its Māori name — is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand’s North Island at 2,518 meters (8,261 feet) and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports.\nThe legal recognition acknowledges the mountain’s theft from the Māori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country’s government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since.\nThe law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te Kāhui Tupua, which the law views as “a living and indivisible whole.” It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, “incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.”\nA newly created entity will be “the face and voice” of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local Māori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country’s Conservation Minister.\nRelated articleNew Zealand is tripling its tourist tax\n“The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,” Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and Māori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday.\nBut colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont.\nIn 1840, Māori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi — New Zealand’s founding document — in which the Crown promised Māori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the Māori and English versions of the treaty differed — and Crown breaches of both began immediately.\nIn 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish Māori for rebelling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain’s management — but Māori did not.\n“Traditional Māori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,” Goldsmith said. But a Māori protest movement of the 1970s and ‘80s has led to a surge of recognition for the Māori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law.\nRedress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements — such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023.\n“Today, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,” said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te Pāti Māori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain.\n“We grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,” she added.\nThe mountain’s legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain.\nRelated articlePacific Indigenous leaders have a new plan to protect whales. Treat them as people\nNew Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island. Government ownership ceased and the tribe Tūhoe became its guardian.\n“Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,” the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to Māori. In 2017, New Zealandrecognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi.\nThe bill recognizing the mountain’s personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament’s 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata — a Māori song — from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki.\nThe unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands ofpeople marched to Parliamentto protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law — which is not expected to pass — would strip Māori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades."

We all respect one another,” he added. “If words cross the line, then there’s got to be consequences. I really don’t say much.

Though Antetokounmpo was eventually able to unleash offensively, Wembanyama retaliated, sinking five three-pointers as he celebrated being named in his first All-Star reserves team.\nIt also marked Wembanyama’s sixth career game in which he posted at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks, the joint-second most by any NBA player in the last 20 seasons, per ESPN.\nSan Antonio will next take the court on Saturday to face the Miami Heat, while the Bucks will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday."

            "text": "Editor’s Note: A new series “Kobe: The Making of a Legend” traces the story of Kobe Bryant from his childhood in Italy to his athletic superstardom and provides an intimate look at his post-NBA aspirations as a storyteller and as a father. The three-part series resumes Saturday at 9 p.m. ET/PT.\nIn 2003,Kobe Bryantwas on top of the world.\nBy that time, seven years after he was drafted, he had already established himself as an NBA superstar, winning three championships with theLos Angeles Lakersand earning five All-Star selections.\nBryantwas a cultural icon, too, transcending basketball in a way that only a select few players in history have managed.\nThere was a new mega signature shoe deal with Nike, various endorsements for fast food, drink and sports companies, plus appearances alongside Hollywood celebrities.\n“He was the king of LA at that point,” Allison Samuels, journalist and writer for The Daily Beast, said in episode two of CNN Original Films and Series’ documentary, “Kobe: The Making of a Legend.”\nAfter the Lakers had won their third straight NBA title in June 2002, the streets of the City of Angels were filled with fans chanting one player’s name: “Kobe, Kobe, Kobe!”\nBryant would soon become a father, with wife Vanessa – who he married in April 2001 after dating less than a year – giving birth to their first daughter, Natalia, in January 2003.\nGiven that Bryant was one of the most sought-after man in LA – perhaps even in the whole of the United States at the time – interviews with news publications and TV channels continued to flow.\nRelated articleHow a tiny basketball court in Italy helped mold Kobe Bryant into an NBA legend\nAll the while, Bryant portrayed an image of being the perfect family man – or a “Superhusband,” as he put it in one interview. One interviewer, after telling Bryant she had done reams of research on him, called him “squeaky clean.”\n“People really thought: ‘Okay, this is a guy who is going home to his wife and his kid, and everything is okay,’” Samuels said.\nHowever, that image was soon shattered forever.\nOn July 1, 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault after an encounter with a 19-year-old who worked at a resort hotel in Colorado, where the Lakers guard had checked in ahead of undergoing knee surgery.\nBryant turned himself into police on July 4, three days after the accuser filed a complaint to authorities, before he was formally charged by district attorney Mark Hurlbert in the small town of Eagle, Colorado, on July 18..\nBryant always maintained the encounter was consensual.\nThe trial and the media scrutiny it drew – the newspaper columns, TV segments and interviews – quickly became a circus. The town of Eagle, a “cute and small” farming and ranching community, was totally “ill-prepared for what was about to happen to them,” Ingrid Bakke, a former prosecutor who worked on the case, said in the documentary.\n“The media attention from day one, that was part of the problem,” Bakke added. “It was crazy. That coverage was crazy.”\nOn July 18, 2003, Bryant held a press conference in Los Angeles alongside wife Vanessa and attorney Pam Mackey in one of his first public appearances since the accusation was made, where he declared, “I’m innocent,” but admitted he was “disgusted” with himself for “making the mistake of adultery.”\nIn the months leading up to his first court appearance on August 6, the documentary shows an overt trend among members of the media, public, and former and currentNBAplayers voicing their support for Bryant.\n“‘She’s just a hotel worker,’” Bakke said in episode two, recounting much of public sentiment to the alleged victim’s claim at the time. “‘Come on, it can’t be true. And even if it is true, she’s just a hotel worker. He’s still Kobe Bryant.’”\nSamuels adds that “people loved him even more” after the allegations, which was evident among the crowd at the 2003 Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards, which took place just two weeks after charges were filed.\nIn front of an adoring, screaming crowd, Bryant was named Male Athlete of the Year and was once again serenaded with chants of “Kobe, Kobe, Kobe” as he made his way onto the stage.\n“That audience, I mean they were in love with him,” Samuels said. “They are like: ‘This is our hero.’ It’s as though nothing has happened.\n“The support was crazy,” she added.\nThe relentless nature of the interrogationof the alleged victim included Mackey naming her six times in open court after the judge had warned her not to do so. Bryant’s attorney later apologized and said she would write herself a note to avoid saying the accuser’s name again.\nMackey declined to be interviewed for the documentary.\nExactly one year after Bryant was arrested, the judge presiding over the case ruled the alleged victim’s sexual history was relevant and would be allowed in trial.\n“It is incredibly invasive and it is incredibly traumatizing,” Hurlbert said of the decision, adding the alleged victim and her family had to move around the country several times due to death threats.\n“The tactics of Mr. Bryant’s team was to throw everything at her and break her down,” Samuels said.\nEventually, they succeeded.\nDuring jury selection, the alleged victim phoned Hurlbert to say she no longer wanted to proceed with the case and instead focus on a recently filed civil suit against Bryant, which was settled privately in March 2005.\n“I know they just lost faith, they just lost faith in the system,” Bakke added.\nAt the time criminal charges were dropped, Kobe apologized to the woman and said in a statement: “Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did.\n“After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”\nOn December 19, 2003, while the charges were still pending, the Los Angeles Lakers hosted the Denver Nuggets in a game that became known for Bryant turning up late to the arena – and then hitting the game winner.\nBryant arrived at Staples Center when there were around four minutes remaining in the first quarter, flying into LA directly from a court hearing in Eagle.\nHe scored just 13 points, but the final two proved the most crucial of the entire game, sinking a 21-foot buzzer-beater to give the Lakers a 101-99 victory over Denver.\n“That takes a strong will,” Tracy McGrady, a seven-time All-Star and friend of Bryant, toldCNN Sportrecently. “A strong-minded and confident individual that has really channeled all of his focus and energy into a space that nothing can penetrate and get him out of that.\n“That was Kobe: he could take his mind somewhere he wants to go and, in the midst of that, nothing can penetrate through to distract him from what he’s trying to achieve.\n“That is a unique ability that takes hours and lots of meditative exercises – and he mastered that.”\nHowever, Mike Sielski, author of a biography on Bryant calledThe Rise: Kobe Bryant and the Pursuit of Immortality, said the announcers were “soft-peddling the nature of what kept him away from the basketball court,” a continuation of the public support he received during the case.\n“They’re framing it in a way that makes it seem as if this is another piece of adversity for him to overcome, instead of a situation in which he is alleged to have done a terrible thing,” Sielski said in the documentary. “A reprehensible thing.”\n“That’s a really tricky dance.”\nAhead of the 2003-04 season, Bryant reached out to performance coach and author ofThe Alter Ego Effect, Todd Herman, with more than 100 Olympic and professional clients.\nHerman told CNN Sport that Bryant wanted help with his mental game going into the season, as the court case continued.\n“Basically, his main issue was: ‘Hey, I feel like I’m losing my edge.’\n“Those were his words. I said: ‘You’re not losing your edge, you’re going through an ego death.’\n“It really resonated with him immediately, that someone else put a name to it that he hadn’t really heard about.”\nEver since coming into the league, Bryant had been adored by legions of fans. But while he continued to enjoy public support during the trial, Herman said Bryant knew that some fans would have turned on him.\n“He wasn’t someone who really battled the crowd before … but he kept on rolling tape over in his head that the upcoming season was going to be a visceral auditory attack on him, calling him names,” Herman said.\n“That version of you, that identity that worked for you before, it’s not going to work in this new world.”\nHerman said coming up with a new alter ego requires a mix of science and art. “It’s a very creative process,” he added.\nGiven Bryant’s main concern appeared to be auditory, Herman began thinking of alter egos – either machine or animal – that had nothing to do with hearing.\nHerman said Bryant liked the idea of what he describes as closed-loop animals – which, unlike what he calls open-loop animals such as humans and dogs, do not share “emotional energy” back and forth – and eventually settled on a snake.\nIt wasn’t until some months later, around April 2004, that Herman said Bryant came up with the idea of theBlack Mamba, a venomous African snake, also the codename for Uma Thurman’s assassin character in theKill Billmovies.\nWhen the alter ego clicked, Herman recalled Bryant getting “very, very excited.”\n“To his credit, I’ll say, a couple of years in, there’s probably nobody on the planet who knew more about black mamba snakes than Kobe.”\nBryant enjoyed many of his best moments on the court after adopting his Black Mamba alter ego.\nThere was his 62-point game against the Mavericks in December 2005 in which he outscored the entire Dallas team through three quarters, before he registered a career-high 81 points the next month against the Toronto Raptors.\nPerhaps no player experienced the Black Mamba up close quite like Jalen Rose.\nOn January 22, 2006, while playing for the Raptors, Rose was given the unenviable task of guarding Bryant.\nBryant scored his career-high that day – the second most in NBA history behind Wilt Chamberlain’s 100 – with Rose being his primary defender for most of the game.\n“The ‘Mamba Mentality’ is a real thing,” Rose told CNN Sport. “What that embodies and what that means to me is: keep the main thing the main thing. He was always disciplined, he was always focused.”\nBryant then won his first and only MVP award in 2008, which was followed by a first NBA title without Shaquille O’Neal as a teammate in 2009, and then a second in 2010.\n“Post-Mamba Kobe has a lot to do with him learning how to use hate to become his power,” Jackson says. “There’s a lot of stuff that happened to this guy. Once he embraced hate, the Mamba just showed up.”"

            "text": "Dick Button, the two-time Olympic champion who revolutionized figure skating and literally took the sport to new heights, died Thursday,US Figure Skating said. He was 95 years old.\nButton died hours after acatastrophic plane crash killed skatersrepresenting the past, present and future of the sport. The tragedy stirred memories of the 1961 plane crash that killed theentire US world figure skating team, including many of Button’s peers.\nBorn Richard Totten Button on July 18, 1929, the daredevil athlete defied both gravity and expectations during his career.\nAt age 12, Button was toldhe would never be a good skater. So he doubled down on his training. And just four years later, at age 16, he became US champion.\nThat was just the beginning of his meteoric rise. Over the next few years, Button attempted dangerous feats that seemed unfathomable at the time but are now routine for elite skaters.\nAt the 1948 Winter Olympics, Button became the first skater to land a double Axel jump in competition. The 18-year-old won gold, becoming the first US Olympic figure skating champion.\nRelated articlePlane crash kills world champion figure skaters and the ‘future’ of the sport in a tragic case of déjà vu\nHe also became the youngest man to ever win Olympic figure skating gold – a distinction that remains unsurpassed more than 70 years later.\nButton’s penchant for taking risks included his debut of the “flying camel” spin. It’s a move where a skater spinning on one leg hurls himself into the air, lands on the other foot, and continues the spin going backward with both the torso and free leg parallel to the ice. The move is sometimes known as the Button camel.\nAfter his first Olympic gold, Button enrolled at Harvard University – yet still managed towin the world figure skating championship every year he was a studentthere, according to The Harvard Crimson.\nAt the next Olympics, the Harvard senior became the first athlete to land a triple jump of any kind – a triple loop – at the 1952 Games. He won that Olympic title, too.\nButton later became a well-known figure skating commentator both admired and dreaded by skaters he critiqued.\n“No other figure skater embodies the sport as much as Dick Button. He is, and always will be, the godfather of this sport,” 1998 Olympic championTara Lipinski said, according to the Sports Video Group.\n“Using his wit, passion, and unfiltered honesty, Dick drew in ever increasing television audiences whether they were new viewers or dedicated fans.”\nEven 1984 Olympic champion Scott Hamilton – who himself became a legendary skating commentator – said he always felt the need to prove himself under Button’s watchful eye.\n“Basically, I spent the last five years of my amateur career doing everything in my power to shut him up,”Hamilton said with a laugh.\n“He was up there not to be a cheerleader, but to be an analyst, and so his criticisms were — to me — very inspiring and very informative.”\nButton’s unique commentary led toa 1981 Emmy Awardfor outstanding sports personality.\nHe critiqued not just the technical elements of skating, but also the artistic side – and skaters he thought fell short in either category.\nAt the 2018 Olympics, Button described a skater whose connection to the music seemed amiss: “She has the opportunity to be smoldering on the ice, but her skating and the music mean nothing to one another,” he said, according toSlate.com.\nBut another athlete garnered some interesting praise: “(Satoko) Miyahara doesn’t have worthless arm movement,” Button said.\nMore than 50 years after his first Olympic gold, Button took to the ice again – but fell and suffered a traumatic brain injury.\n“What happened was that I must have tried a jump, and I fell,”Button recalled in 2003.\n“All I know is the blood was coming out of my ear. I had a concussion, and I lost the hearing in (one) ear.”\nButton said he didn’t even remember his first month of recovery.\n“I’m told I had to be put in a straitjacket for the first five days because I was so violent, which is a reflection of having really damaged your brain,” he said.\nBut once again, Button defied expectations. After extensive rehabilitation, he relearned how to walk and became a national spokesman for the Brain Injury Association of America.\nBy 2006, Button was back in the commentators’ booth for the Winter Olympics in Torino, delivering his refreshingly blunt analyses.\nHis sense of humor was still intact, too. After his life-threatening injury, Button reportedly said: “I’m fine. I’m here,and I’m wreaking havoc as usual.”"

Being told that suddenly you have a spinal cord injury and you have no idea what a spinal cord injury is,” he tellsCNN Sport.\nNot long after his accident in 2016, Edwards’ girlfriend at the time ended their relationship, and following months of surgery, intensive care and rehabilitation, he found his life had changed drastically.\n“I remember not being able to find people that I could take hope from and people that had shown that what life was like after an injury wasn’t all negative,” he explains.\nBut since his accident, Edwards has dedicated his life to exploration, already completing more physically demanding challenges than most do in a lifetime.\nA disabled adventurer, he has completed seven marathons on seven continents over seven days; at the end of this year, he aims to ski 207 miles in 20 days across Antarctica to the South Pole.\nI’m not someone that cares about being able to say that I was the first or the furthest or the fastest … It comes from a place inside and from a desire to push the boundaries for myself.”\nDarren Edwards on his Antarctica challenge\nEdwards will be using a sit-ski – “a wheelchair without wheels” – which involves using poles to propel himself forward for roughly 12 hours a day.\nAside from the skiing, the journey with two friends will be challenging in other ways: he will be setting up camp on the snow, melting ice for water and will need to ensure he doesn’t develop frostbite, especially on the parts of his body he can’t feel.\nTemperatures will be around -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius), and there is the added risk of high winds, altitude sickness, exhaustion, snowstorms and crevasses.\nNine years on from his life-altering brush with death, Edwards wants to inspire others through his exploits, on top of raising around $400,000 (£300,000) for people with spinal cord injuries with his Antarctica challenge.\n“I’m not someone that cares about being able to say that I was the first or the furthest or the fastest – I’ve not done a single expedition or adventure for that accolade. It comes from a place inside and from a desire to push the boundaries for myself,” he explains to CNN.\n“I take a lot of pride in thinking that what I do today and what I do tomorrow will help to show someone going through that right now, (when) it’s raw and it’s hurtful, there – in the darkest moment – there is light at the end of the tunnel and that there is hope for the future,” he adds.\nFriendship is central to Edwards’ life, and he credits his best friend Matt Luxton’s quick thinking for saving his life on the day of his accident. As Edwards fell to the ground, Luxton made a split-second decision to jump on top of his climbing partner, ensuring that they both fell on a ledge instead of Edwards plummeting off the rockface.\nBefore his accident, the 34-year-old was fit, active and loved being in the mountains. Soon after, he wanted to work towards new adventures and challenges.\n“I took for granted that tomorrow I could walk up a mountain or go for a run up a hill, and I didn’t really savor those moments,” Edwards says.\n“And then coming out of hospital and having to start at square one, you know, the real basics of trying and learning to kayak over and over and over again … I learned to celebrate the little wins. You know, if I could get one meter further into the lake before falling in, that was a huge win.”\nHe also says that he is grateful to his friends and family for helping him to achieve his goals, highlighting the importance of teamwork in his adventures.\n“I’ve been surrounded by people that have empowered me, have encouraged me to think bigger,” Edwards explains. “When I said I want to buy a kayak and learn to kayak, they didn’t say no. They said, ‘Okay, let’s see how we make it possible.’”\nI took for granted that tomorrow I could walk up a mountain or go for a run up a hill, and I didn’t really savor those moments.”\nDarren Edwards on life before his accident and injury\nIn 2023, Edwards was part of a three-person fully disabled teamskiing acrossVatnajökull, Europe’s largest icecap in Iceland – something which inspired his upcoming expedition in Antarctica.\n“It was midway through that expedition that I realized that for the first time in seven years, I was back in the mountains, I was back on snow, I was back on the ice, and I really felt like I’d sort of found a piece of myself that I’d lost,” Edwards says.\n“I’ve learned to take a step back and to look at life and all of the great things in gratitude once more. And I think I’ve also learned to chase the dream, and whether that ends in failure or success, there is a kind of meaning in both. And there is a lesson to be learned and a future beyond.”"

            "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface — even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet’s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous “supercontinents” buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet’s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn’t as well-stirred by Earth’s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journalNature.\nRelated articleEarth’s core has slowed so much it’s moving backward, scientists confirm. Here’s what it could mean\n“These findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,” saidClaire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n“Resolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,” Richardson told CNN in an email. “Open questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what’s really going on down there.”\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth’s deep interior.\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, saidDr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n“Their origin and whether they are long-lived structures — it’s widely debated,” Talavera-Soza said.\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic wavesled geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were “kind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,” said study coauthorDr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth’s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n“There was no information about that,” Deuss said. “We only knew that seismic waves slowed down.”\nRelated articleEarth’s innermost layer is a 400-mile-wide ball of iron, new study suggests\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones’ composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves — along with changes in wave speed — could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs’ makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave’s energy.\nOtherstudies revealedthat the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were “slab graveyards” of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves’ velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn’t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n“The fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,” Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n“Our study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,” Talavera-Soza said. “This implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.”\nRelated articleHidden molten rock layer found beneath Earth’s tectonic plates\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more “sunken worlds” that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth’s subduction zones — regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year,another team of scientistsidentified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents’ interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n“Apparently, such zones in the Earth’s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,” saidThomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,in a statement.\nThe model in the new study — the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle — will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth’s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n“It maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth’s interior,” she said.\nThe findings could transform researchers’ understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth’s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n“These LLSVPs have been there for a long time — if they’ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can’t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,” Deuss said.\n“From this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

The spacecraft had broken apart minutes after liftoff from South Texas during its seventh test flight.\nOver the next few days, Kaine and other residents founddebris from the explosive mishaplittering their driveways and beaches.\nSpaceX’s response to the incident has drawn criticism, raising broader questions about the company’s approach to developing Starship and its decision to launch the vehicle’s test flights out of South Texas on a path that takes the spacecraft over populated areas.\nMeanwhile, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, the veteran astronauts at thecenter of the Boeing Starliner drama, have kept busy on their extended stay,stepping out for a spacewalkafter more than seven months in orbit.\nThe elusive creature pointed its long snout skyward, pausing a moment after eating some mealworms.\nThe Mount Lyell shrew was unaware it was the first of its species to be photographed by humans — specifically recently graduated wildlife photographer Vishal Subramanyan, along with student scientists Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes.\nThe trio ventured out into the eastern Sierra Nevada and captured six live Mount Lyell shrews (Sorex lyelli).

            "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nSpace agencies are keeping a close eye on a recently discovered asteroid that has a small chance of impacting Earth. Named 2024 YR4, the asteroid has a 1.2% chance of hitting our planet on December 22, 2032, theEuropean Space AgencyandNASAhave found.\nBut that also means the space rock has a nearly 99% chance of safely passing by Earth in 2032, according to the ESA and NASA. Future observations of the asteroid will help scientists determine the likelihood of an impact.\nThe asteroid is estimated to be between 131 and 328 feet (40 and 100 meters) wide. Asteroids of this size impact Earth every few thousand years, and they can cause severe damage to local regions, according to the ESA.\nThe space rock has a “size range comparable to that of a large building,” said Dr. Paul Chodas, director for the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, or CNEOS, at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Chodas added that the actual size of the asteroid, which astronomers are trying to determine with follow-up observations using multiple telescopes, is currently highly uncertain.\n“If the asteroid turns out to be on the large end of its estimated size range, the impact could produce blast damage as far as 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the impact site,” Chodas said. “But that’s in the unlikely event that it might impact at all. The potential for damage arises because of the incredibly high speed (about 17 kilometers per second, or 38,028 miles per hour) at which the asteroid would enter the atmosphere.”\nThe Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, or ATLAS, telescope located in Rio Hurtado, Chile, first spied the space rock on December 27. The telescope is one of the asteroid discovery programs funded by NASA to scan the sky in search of near-Earth asteroids, said Davide Farnocchia, navigation engineer at JPL and CNEOS.\n“The discovery happened while the asteroid was in the Earth’s neighborhood, which made it bright enough to be detected,” Farnocchia said.\nAutomated asteroid warning systems sent out an alarm after determining the asteroid had a slim chance of impacting Earth in 2032, bumping it to the top of the ESA’s asteroid risk list and NASA’s automated Sentry risk list on December 31. Such lists include any known asteroids with a nonzero probability of colliding with Earth.\nSince early January, astronomers have used the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico, the Danish Telescope and the Very Large Telescope in Chile to track the asteroid, which is currently 28 million miles (45 million kilometers) from Earth and moving farther away over time, Farnocchia said. The observations can also help researchers refine their estimates of the asteroid’s size and trajectory.\nAs the asteroid moves away from Earth and becomes fainter, researchers will have to rely on larger telescopes to observe it. The celestial object should be visible through early April, and as it continues on its orbit around the sun, it won’t return to Earth’s vicinity until 2028, Farnocchia said.\nIf 2024 YR4 disappears from view before space agencies can entirely rule out any chance of impact, the space rock will remain on the risk list until it’s back in view in 2028.\n“Using the available tracking data, we can predict the future position of an asteroid,” Farnocchia said. “The longer we track an asteroid, the more precise the prediction. As we collect additional data, the uncertainty in the position of 2024 YR4 in 2032 will decrease. Given that the impact probability is only 1%, it is 99% likely that the Earth will eventually fall outside the swath of possible positions and that the probability would fall to zero.”\nRelated articleHistoric asteroid sample reveals the ‘building blocks of life are in fact extraterrestrial in origin,’ scientists say\nIt’s not uncommon for an asteroid’s impact probability to rise shortly after its discovery before that probability drops to zero after scientists learn more about its size and trajectory, according to the European Space Agency.\nNASA and the ESA regularly track thousands of near-Earth asteroids, but depending on the size, they are not always easy to spot. But improvements in asteroid survey technology, andfuture asteroid-spotting missions, could detect the space rocks astronomers haven’t been able to see in the past. Currently, there are no other known large asteroids that have more than a 1% chance of impacting Earth, according to NASA.\nTwo international asteroid response groups endorsed by the United Nations — the International Asteroid Warning Network, chaired by NASA, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group, chaired by ESA — have activated in response to the threat level.\nThe International Asteroid Warning Network is responsible for coordinating the organizations involved in tracking and characterizing the details of the asteroid — and if necessary, developing strategies to assess the consequences of an impact.\nMeanwhile, the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group, currently convening in an already-planned meeting in Vienna through next week, will provide recommendations and evaluate options for how to mitigate a potential impact if the asteroid remains a threat. Mitigation tactics include deflecting the asteroid in space or evacuating potentially impacted regions on the ground, Farnocchia said.\nNASA carried out the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, called the DART mission, in September 2022 to assess the effectiveness of asteroid deflection technology. The agency wanted to see whether a kinetic impact — such asintentionally crashing a spacecraft into an asteroidat 13,645 miles per hour (6.1 kilometers per second) — would be enough to change the motion of a celestial object in space.\nRelated articleEarth’s recent ‘mini-moon’ may be an actual piece of the moon, astronomers say\nThe DART spacecraft successfully changed the way a tiny asteroid called Dimorphos moves, shifting the moonlet asteroid’s orbital period — or how long it takes to make a single revolution around a larger space rock called Didymos — by about 32 minutes.\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses a danger to Earth. Still, the double-asteroid system was a perfect target on which to test deflection technology because Dimorphos’ size is comparable to asteroids that could threaten our planet.\nNow, an ESA mission called Hera is on its way toassess the aftermath of the DART impactto determine whether the collision merely left behind a crater or if the spacecraft’s momentumcompletely reshaped Dimorphos. Both agencies see the mission as a necessary step to understand the final outcome of DART’s deflection test. Measuring DART’s efficiency is crucial in case a similar strategy may need to be used against an asteroid on a collision course with Earth in the future.\n“If 2024 YR4 remained a threat at the end of the current observing window, mitigation measures might be considered,” Farnocchia said. “But talk of mitigation is premature. The priority right now is to keep observing 2024 YR4 and reduce its positional uncertainties in 2032, since this is likely to rule out the impact.”"

            "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nCorals aren’t necessarily known for their fancy footwork — or even having feet. But scientists have observed a free-living mushroom coral, Cycloseris cyclolites, actively “walking” toward blue light waves in a way that’s reminiscent of thepulsed swimming motion of jellyfish, a new study has revealed.\nMost corals are sessile organisms, which remain permanently attached to a substrate or base, such as algae that grows on a rock, throughout their lifespan. C. cyclolites similarly begins life anchored to one spot but becomes mobile as it matures, causing its stem to dissolve.\nThe species is commonly found throughout the Indo-Pacific, with some evidence also suggesting they may be present in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, according to Dr. Brett Lewis, the study’s lead author and postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Queensland University of Technology in Australia.\nThe reef areas where C. cyclolites corals break away are typically high-energy zones with strong waves and significant competition for space. These poor environmental factors force small members of the species — measuring up to 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) — to migrate quickly to deeper waters. Relocating like this helps the corals survive and reproduce due to the lower wave energy and reduced temperature and competition for resources such as food and sunlight in their new surroundings, according to the study published January 22 in the scientific journalPLOS One.\nWhile previous research had shown some free-living corals had the ability to move when exposed to light or sunlight, the finer details of how the creatures navigate their surroundings remained unknown because of poor resolution imaging systems.\nNow, the new study has confirmed that C. cyclolites moves actively through a technique known as pulsed inflation when exposed to blue light, allowing it to migrate to light sources that resemble its natural environment, Lewis said.\nThe distinctive movement seen in C. cyclolites suggests that free-living corals may have more complex body functions, similar to jellyfish — the evolutionary cousin of coral — than scientists previously believed, according to Lewis.\nLewis and his team collected five C. cyclolites specimens off the coast of Cairns, Australia, before transporting them to an aquarium at Queensland University of Technology. There, the scientists conducted both single and dual light trials, testing the corals’ response to blue and white wavelengths individually before displaying the light sources simultaneously.\nC. cyclolites showed a strong preference for blue light, with most of the corals exhibiting a positive phototactic response, or one that caused them to move toward the light source.\nThe movement was classified by periodic pulses, or bursts of mobility that lasted for one to two hours. During the blue light trials, some corals moved up to 220 millimeters (8.7 inches) over a 24-hour period. It’s possible that the corals could have traveled farther, but they had to stop when they reached the tank wall.\nIn contrast, only 13.3% of the samples moved in response to white light and traveled significantly smaller distances when they did, with the farthest coral traveling only 8 millimeters (0.3 inches).\nWhen competing fields of blue and white light were presented together, all corals moved toward the blue light while avoiding the white light.\nLewis compared the corals’ behavior to that of humans at the beach: “When you go under (the water) and look back at the shore, it’s bright and clear, but when you turn around and look deeper into the ocean, it becomes dark and blue,” he said via email.\nFor C. cyclolites, however, this upwelling blue light serves as a directional cue, helping corals move toward deeper, calmer waters.\nRelated articleElusive Californian mammal captured on camera for first time ever\n“Many ocean-dwelling species rely on light, particularly those in shallower waters where light actively penetrates, so new information of how a species like C. cyclolites can contribute to our understanding of how species develop light-responsive behavior and may even lead to new studies about how species such as this detect and respond to light,” marine biologist Andrew Davies said via email. Davies, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Rhode Island, was not involved in the study.\nArmed with high-resolution time-lapse imaging, researchers observed and documented the complex biomechanics of the C. cyclolites.\nThe team first recorded the corals’ passive movement, which is considered their primary mode of migration once they become mobile, according to the study.\nPassive movement relies on wave energy and gravity. The ocean’s waves generate enough force to move the corals — sometimes in the wrong direction — but gravity and the slope of the reef tend to move the creatures back down.\nWhen the waves and the reef’s natural slope combine, the mushroom corals are gradually pushed down to the fore reef area, which is generally a calmer, sandy seabed environment. From there, a coral can use its active mobility, or “walking,” skills to move deeper and search for like-minded coral communities, Lewis said.\nResearchers found that C. cyclolites’ active movement toward the blue light source was influenced by three main factors: tissue inflation, expansion of pads on its underside, and the twisting and contracting of the coral’s outer tissues.\nTogether, these mechanisms form what is known as pulsed inflation, in which the coral’s tissues expand and quickly contract beyond their usual baseline as a survival technique, according to the study.\n“The challenge with passive locomotion is that it is a relatively quick but risky strategy. On occasion, organisms can get transported into unfavorable areas and don’t have much control of where or how they land, it could even be upside down or trapped in a hole,” Davies said. “Whereas, with active and cue-driven locomotion, which is slower but safer, organisms have a degree of control over when and where they move, providing a better chance of ending up in a suitable area.”\nRelated articleGiant ‘Darth Vader’ sea bug discovered off the coast of Vietnam\nJellyfish also use pulsed inflation to swim through the water, but the pulsed inflation recorded in C. cyclolites generates a “walking” movement across a surface. While jellyfish have been more extensively studied, researchers suggest that corals such as C. cyclolites may possess a comparable nervous system because of their similar complex movements.\nLewis and Davies noted that this research might also offer clues to similar movement patterns across multiple coral species or possibly help researchers develop future conservation strategies.\n“If C. cyclolites is showing such strong responses to light, it could help us understand how other corals utilize light, whether it is for spawning, the behavior of larvae or the development of light-sensing cells,” Davies said.\n“This study may also be helpful for coral restoration or ranching programs where people are rearing corals to restore areas that have seen loss of habitat, as understanding their ecology is vital for ensuring successful outcomes.”"

            "text": "It was a typical balmy afternoon across the tropical islands that lie southeast of Florida, where tens of thousands of tourists flock this time of year for winter break. But on January 16, just after sundown, aspacecrafterupted into a ball of flames over the North Atlantic Ocean near Turks and Caicos Islands.\nThe upper stage of a SpaceX Starship launch system, the most powerful rocket ever built, had broken apart minutes after liftoff from South Texas during its seventh test flight, fracturing into a cloud of debris that streaked through the evening sky. Blazing orange and white, the astonishing spectacle left onlookers gazing in awe from beaches and cruise ships — with many posting the bizarre scene to social media.\nWere they meteorites? Satellites? The harbingers of the end of the world?\n“I just never have seen colors like that in the sky,” said Lori Kaine, a resident of Providenciales, the main island of the Turks and Caicos archipelago. “At first, I thought it was an actual plane that had exploded.”\nThe noise was deafening, she recalled. Even inside with her doors and windows closed, Kaine said she could still hear thejarring boom.One of her dogs panicked while another could be heard crying outside, she said.\nIt wasn’t until Kaine checked the flood of messages on her phone that she first came across reports about the failed Starship spacecraft.\nThe next morning, in the light of day, Kaine said she began to take stock of the fallout.\nA mysterious cable had landed in her driveway. Broken hexagon tiles — likely part of Starship’s heat shield — littered the roadway where Kaine typically walks her dogs, she said. The nearby beach was similarly strewn with debris.\n“I’m like, ‘OK, this is crazy’ — because (the Starship pieces are)  on the inner roads of the island and over on the beach,” Kaine said.\nTurks and Caicos, a British territory located525 miles(925 kilometers) southeast of Miami that includes 40 islands, eight of which are inhabited, appears to be the area that was hardest hit by the falling Starship debris. No injuries resulting from the explosion have been reported, but multiple residents say the rocket parts did land near homes and have washed up along beaches near tourist hot spots. There has been one reported incident of property damage.\nSpaceX’s response to the incident has drawn criticism from Turks and Caicos residents. And the ordeal raises broader questions about the company’s approach to developing Starship — the gargantuan rocket system SpaceX hopes will one day carry humans to the moon and Mars — and its decision to launch the vehicle’s test flights out of South Texas, on a path that takes the spacecraft over populated areas.\nAfter the Starship broke apart, the Federal Aviation Administration activated a “Debris Response Area,” which meant the agency briefly locked down airspace near Turks and Caicos. The US agency licenses commercial rocket launches and is overseeing an investigation into the incident.\nThe DRA alert and resultingflight diversionsled to a cascade of travel delays.\nDebris has now been found all over the islands, according to a database put together by local environmental group Turks and Caicos Reef Fund in partnership with the government’s Department of Environment and Coastal Resources.\nWreckage has washed up on every beach on Providenciales, as well as “from South Caicos to West Caicos which essentially spans the entirety of the Caicos Banks,” said Alizee Zimmermann, the executive director of the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund, aUS-registered nonprofit.\nThe reports also include at least one instance of property damage: Debris reportedly struck a car in South Caicos, Zimmermann said.\nThe FAA confirmed to CNN on Friday that it verified a report of “minor damage to a vehicle located in South Caicos.” There we no injuries or other reported instances of damage, the agency previously said.\nStarship is still a work in progress, prone to explosive mishaps.\nSpaceX — unlike NASA and some of the company’s competitors in the aerospace industry — embraces a strategy called “rapid iterative development.” The approach emphasizes building prototypes and accepting added risk during test flights, which launch from the company’s Starbase facilities located on Texas’ southernmost tip.\nPrevious Starship flights have resulted in explosions over the Gulf of Mexico and other areas of the ocean. The vehicle’s first test mission notably blew up a launchpad in South Texas, causing a blizzard of debris and sparkingbacklash from environmentalists. However, the January 16 test flight stands out because of the Starship’s proximity to populated islands at the time it malfunctioned.\nSpaceX maintains that its “rapid iterative development” approach allows engineers to learn and adjust Starship’s design more cheaply and quickly than if it were to rely on more traditional approaches and extensive ground testing.\nBut the strategy also frequently puts SpaceX in the hot seat when test flights do not go according to plan.\n“Just being witnesses to this explosion and actually receiving debris, it makes you question a lot of things too,” Florida resident Elena Zavet, who was visiting Turks and Caicos during the explosion,toldCNN affiliate WSVN. “Like is this safe?”\nIn its statement to CNN, the FAA said that the Turks and Caicos government was made aware prior to the Starship launch that the nation was located within a possible hazard area.\nThe agency also said that, before the test flight launched, it required SpaceX to map out “hazard areas sufficient to ensure that the probability of casualty to a member of the public on land or on board a maritime vessel does not exceed one in one million.”\n“No Caribbean islands, including Turks and Caicos, exceeded this threshold,” the agency said.\nIn general, Turks and Caicos residents have expressed disappointment in the response from SpaceX.\n“I’m into the launches and what (SpaceX CEO Elon) Musk is doing — but I think he should be liable for the cleanup, too,” said Amos Luker, the owner of a car rental business on Providenciales called Scooter Bob’s.\n“There’s not been big warnings going out whatsoever,” he added, referring to limited communication about the potentially hazardous nature of the debris.\nSpaceX did not share any information about the location of the explosion or how to handle debris on X, where the company’s account has nearly40 million followers.\nThe company did say in a statement on itswebsitethat people should contact SpaceX if debris is found and refrain from touching the objects. That post also noted that SpaceX believed “surviving pieces of debris would have fallen into the designated hazard area.” (Initially, the statement described debris as falling “into the Atlantic Ocean” — but the language was amended the day after the accident to remove that phrase.)\nIn the same statement, SpaceX sought to frame the Starship flight as a milestone, saying, “success comes from what we learn, and this flight test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.”\nCynthia Filo, the manager and captain of Silly Creek Water Sports in Providenciales, told CNN she has also found wreckage — a fact that she finds “unsettling for the areas that I found it in, because it’s way up in the pond area.\n“So it’s already come in from the ocean and gone miles inland,” Filo said. On Wednesday, she told CNN she discovered a fragment next to her house, which she said she believes may have fallen off the roof days after the incident.\nZimmermann of the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund said she is aware that “a multiagency response is being planned with the key focus on cleanup.” And a recentdispatchfrom authorities showed that local officials met with several members of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, an arm of the United Kingdom’s Department for Transport, last week.\nBut residents are still waiting for something to be done. “We’re just trying to put forward a plea to at least help assist us in financing the cleanup that’s being done through volunteers,” Zimmermann added.\nKaine, who lives on Providenciales, said she began to collect detritus from Starship the day after the January 16 explosion.\nThe objects she gathered left her hands covered in soot and grime. She estimated there are now “easily 200 pounds (91 kilograms)” of debris in her collection, stashed away in garbage bags labeled with the location where she picked up the debris. Plenty more still litters the beaches, she said.\nBut it was not until the day after the explosion, on January 17, that Kaine became aware that interacting with the debris could be dangerous.\nThe Turks and Caicos National Security Secretariat posted a notice toFacebook, saying the government is “not aware of any specific risks” — but “space objects can sometimes contain hazardous materials which can cause serious harm to health.”\nThe notice recommended residents not touch the debris and to contact the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) government or SpaceX.\nKaine said she grew frustrated.\nFor one, it was over 24 hours before she learned that exposure to the materials could be dangerous.\nShe also worried that the debris, left alone, would soon be covered by sand — literally burying the fallout from SpaceX’s explosive mishap and perhaps further threatening the ecology of the island.\nSpaceX also took a week to respond to a voicemail she left with the company’s hotline, Kaine told CNN. And even then, she was told representatives from the company would not arrive for another few days.\n“There’s not going to be a problem finding debris when they get here,” Kaine said of SpaceX. “If they want me to find it, I can find it.”\nAccording to a January 23 Facebook update from the local government, SpaceX representatives were scheduled to be on the island that day. Neither the company nor the government responded to requests for comment.\nKaine said she still has the debris stored at her home.\nHours after sending out its first communication on January 17, the day after the explosion, the TCI National Security Secretariat issued another dispatch, saying “initial discussions between the UK Space Agency and SpaceX” have “confirmed that no Hydrazine was on board the Starship rocket.”\nHydrazine is a type of propellant used on some spacecraft that can cause nausea, vomiting, inflammation of the nerves and even a coma following exposure.\nSpaceX’s Starship does not use such fuels. The megarocket instead relies on liquid methane and oxygen for propellant — but “any kind of fuel is going to … have a bunch of chemical energy inside it,” according to Marlon Sorge, the executive director of the Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies at The Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center.\n“Even if it isn’t as dangerous as hydrazine, where you touch it or get close to it and you’re in trouble — it’s still volatile, like gasoline,” Sorge added. “And there are other things on board spacecraft, like batteries.”\nHe added that it is possible for entire rocket fuel tanks to survive the trip down to the ground: “If they’re weakened, you touch them, they blow up.”\nThat’s likely why local authorities advised residents not to touch any debris “out of an abundance of caution,” as the Turks and Caicos governmentwrotein a January 17 notice.\n“It’s not that it’s a death sentence to get close to one of these things,” Sorge said. “Mostly they’re probably OK, but it is potentially risky. And it’s not worth people getting injured.”\nBut many people who came across the detritus have started to collect the objects — some individuals took them home as souvenirs, while others are aiming to sell them for profit.\nOne eBay listing for a heat shield tile allegedly recovered from Turks and Caicos has a bid for$3,000. A look at previously sold remnants of destroyed Starship spacecraft show the items have fetchedup to $2,000.\nBut selling or keeping a piece of a SpaceX craft could be legally questionable, Sorge noted. According to the1967 Outer Space Treaty, “technically, (the debris) still belongs to the launching organization.”\nZimmermann said on Monday that, although cleanup efforts may be underway soon, she is not aware of concrete plans to evaluate the Starship explosion’s environmental footprint.\nShe added that she hopes there will be a formal assessment that would include testing the waters for signs of contamination and conducting exploratory surveys that might use drones to hunt for large pieces of debris at sea, which could be impacting sensitive ecosystems.\n“But all that requires a lot of coordination and a fair amount of funding — and both of those are limited here,” Zimmermann said.\n“It’s not been the best response,” she added. “I think there’s not a lot of precedent for this type of event either in such a populated area. But there’s debris as small as a third of a fingernail and as large as a car scattered around.”\nKaine said she’s grown wary of SpaceX’s response to the ordeal and the Starship program in general. She said she’s not interested in keeping any of the debris she collected. Her goal is to keep the roadways and beaches she frequents clean and free of dangerous materials.\n“You need to come pick this up,” Kaine said of SpaceX. “And my concern has grown on a larger level about these launches, because now that I’m reading about it — there’s such limited information out there.”"

On Friday, Firefly released footage that Blue Ghost took of Earth eclipsing the moon as the spacecraft traveled in orbit.\n“Firefly’s first Moon andBlue Marbleimages captured by our Blue Ghost lunar lander embodies everything this bold, unstoppable team has worked so hard for over the last three years. And we’re just getting started,” said Will Coogan, Firefly’s Blue Ghost chief engineer, in an email.\nBlue Ghost has been orbiting Earth since January 15, when the lander hitched a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The lunar spacecraft is expected to leave Earth’s orbit in about one week, embarking on a four-day journey to the moon. Blue Ghost will orbit our celestial neighbor for 16 days before attempting a descent to the lunar surface.\n“Blue Ghost is a third of its way to the Moon, and we expect to capture even more breathtaking imagery,” Coogan said. “Most importantly, we’ll be capturing critical science data for our NASA customers all along the way that will pave the way for a lasting lunar presence and unlock exploration further into our solar system.”\nThe lander carries 10NASA science and technologyinstruments aboard as part of the space agency’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, initiative, that will collect and send back data on the moon. CLPS is part of NASA’s broader Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.\nSo far, all NASA technology aboard is “healthy” and operating as expected, the NASA Artemis blogannounced on Monday.\nFirefly CEO Jason Kimpreviously told CNNthat he is excited about sharing images and footage that Blue Ghost captures.\n“There’s a phenomenon called thelunar horizon glow(scattered light caused by floating electrostatic particles) that only theApollo 15and17 astronautshave seen with their eyes,” Kim said. “We’re going to be able to capture that in 4K-by-4K high-definition video and share that with the rest of the world.”\nThe company plans to capture HD imagery of atotal lunar eclipsefrom the moon when Earth will move directly between our neighbor and the sun as it travels along its orbital path. On Earth, those in the path of totality will see the moon passing completely into Earth’s shadow, causing the moon to take on a reddish hue. It will be visible between March 13-14 for Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica.\nRelated articleEarth’s recent ‘mini-moon’ may be an actual piece of the moon, astronomers say\nIf all goes well, Blue Ghost will land on the far eastern edge of the moon’s near side by Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or “Sea of Crises.” The lander will then perform surface operations for one lunar day (about 14 Earth days) before it faces lunar nighttime, where the period of darkness and cold temperatures are expected to cause the spacecraft to cease operations."

            "text": "Dutch police have arrested three people in connection with amuseum heistthat saw thievesblow open a doorwith explosives before stealing four priceless ancient artifacts, including an approximately 2,500-year-old gold helmet on loan from Romania.\nOfficials in the Netherlands published the names and photographs of two of the suspects, Douglas Chesley Wendersteyt and Bernhard Zeeman, on Thursday, less than a week after the heist at Drents Museum in Assen, roughly 80 miles northeast of Amsterdam. The third person, a woman, was not named by police.\nAll three suspects hail from the city of Heerhugowaard in the Netherlands, police said, more than 70 miles from the museum.\nThe daring heist occurred during the early hours of Saturday morning, according to Dutch police, who received a report of an explosion at 3:45 a.m. local time. Grainy CCTV footage shows suspects opening an exterior door before a blast sends sparks and smoke into the air.\nAmong the stolen items, which have not yet been recovered, are three 2,000-year-old gold bracelets and the Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important item on loan from the National History Museum of Romania. Dutch police have described finding the artifacts as their “absolute priority,” appealing for information from the public.\nInvestigators say they tracked down the suspects after discovering a bag containing clothing in Assen. They also searched properties in Heerhugowaard.\nPolice are appealing for information about a black van, which they say may have been driven by one of the thieves following the heist, as well as various tools used during the break-in — including hammers and a crowbar. Officials havereleased imagesof another man, seen at a hardware store in Assen, who is also linked to the heist.\nThe four stolen items were part of an exhibition about the Dacians, an ancient society that occupied much of present-day Romania before being conquered by the Romans.\nDrents Museum describes the Helmet of Cotofenesti — which was uncovered in a Romanian village almost a century ago — as a “masterpiece.” Its design features mythological scenes and a pair of golden eyes that were thought to deter enemies during battle, while protecting against the “evil eye.”\nRelated articleFive of the most daring museum heists in modern history\nConsidered a Romanian national treasure, its theft has sparked consternation among Romanian officials and fears that the gold helmet, which weighs around two pounds, would be melted down.\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis has hailed the artifacts as having “exceptional cultural and historical importance,” according to the Associated Press, and said their disappearance had “a strong emotional and symbolic impact on society.”\nPrime Minister Marcel Ciolacu also said the Romanian government had not authorized the loan and that he will seek damages from the Netherlands if they are not recovered, according to CNN affiliate Antena 3.\nRomania’s Culture Minister Natalia-Elena Intotero said she had dismissed the National History Museum’s director, Ernest Oberländer-Târnoveanu, over his handling of the crisis, Antena 3 reported.\nOberlander-Tarnoveanu had earlier called the heist an incident that “even in our most pessimistic dreams, we would not have believed possible,” according to the AP.\nCNN has reached out to Romania’s National History Museum and the Drents Museum.\nDrents Museum has remained closed since the heist but is due to reopen to the public Friday. Its premises were damaged by the explosion, though no injuries were reported.\nThe museum’s general director, Harry Tupan, described the incident as a “dark day” — both for his institution and the National History Museum of Romania.\nIn astatementWednesday, Drents Museum welcomed the arrests as “hopeful news.”\n“The safe return of the stolen artifacts would be a fantastic next step for all involved. Not only for us, but especially for the Romanian people,” the museum said."

            "text": "Editor’s Note: CNN Style is one of the official media partners ofParis Fashion Week. See all coveragehere.\nHaute couture is an enigma to most. Accessible to only a select few (an estimated few thousand people globally) because of the eye-watering price tags that such extraordinary designs command, the fashion designers who partake in the exclusive event in Paris must ensure that strict criteria are met, in order to be approved by the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, France’s governing fashion body.\nTaking place following men’s fashion week, during which ready-to-wear designs are shown, the haute couture shows serve a wholly different purpose. The pieces are not intended for everyday wear and cannot simply be purchased off the rails at a department store (couture clients make direct orders and have private fittings). With that, the designs are often more experimental than commercial, and showcase exceptional savoir-faire.\nThe week had plenty of celebratory moments, including Chanel’s 110 years in haute couture. Presented in the Grand Palais, on a runway that featured a crossing C formed by two monumental staircases, reflecting the house’s double-C logo, the collection was designed by the studio while awaiting the arrival of new designer Matthieu Blazy, who is expected to join by April 2025.\nThe cropped skirt-suits in richly embroidered tweeds, embellished hem and shoulder lines, soft silk shirt dresses and capes with pussy-bow fastening offered a fresh take on the French house’s classic codes.\nAnother big milestone was celebrated by Giorgio Armani, who celebrated 20 years of his couture line Armani Privé with a collection that explored themes of light and shimmer. Titled “Lumières” (French for “light” and “enlightenment”, the 90-year-old designer’s show was held at the newly acquired Palazzo Armani in the 8th arrondissement, a lavish private mansion complete with gilded moldings and a marble staircase.\nThe collection, comprised of 94 looks, including beaded suits, sleek peplums, silky Mao jackets, crystal-encrusted evening gowns and 1920-inspired headpieces, revisited iconic moments of his career, providing a dialogue between the glamour of more recent and distant pasts, When it comes to Armani’s work, the devil really is in the details.\nFor Alessandro Michele, the designer of Valentino, luxury means taking time, as he explained backstage after presenting his first couture collection for the Italian house. Under his creative leadership, Valentino now stages one couture show a year, instead of the typical two. Michele compared the experience of haute couture to a ritual, describing the process as a labor of patience.\nHeld at the Palais Brongniart, Paris’s former stock exchange, each look appeared with a number displayed behind them, a nod to early haute couture presentations, when models would carry cards with their look numbers. A Harlequin crinoline dress, moiré Ottoman pants, a poppy-red bolero jacket, ruffled collars and other nods to Ancien Régime, the social and political order that existed in France from the late Middle Ages until the French Revolution, seamlessly merged, underlining Michele’s knack for interweaving genres and epochs.\nAmong Michele’s influences were Stanley Kubrick’s 1975 black comedy-drama film “Barry Lyndon”, Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel “Orlando” and Umberto Eco’s 2009 literary anthology “The Infinity of Lists”. The designer also emphasized his fascination with the concept of lists, which served as a creative starting point for the collection. “Creating a handmade dress is like drafting a never-ending list, with many pieces composing this mosaic,” he said.\nThe inspiration also took a physical form on the runway, where a list of unconnected words, such as “Sigmund Freud”, “crêpe-de-chine” and “Bloody Mary”, alluding to each of the model’s looks, scrolled past on a giant screen.\nCrinolines also appeared on the Dior runway. Held at Musée Rodin on the Left Bank, the show was something of a blockbuster event, attended by stars including Pamela Anderson, Venus Williams and Jenna Ortega, who sat on the front row\nSome models wore crinoline styles in raffia and lace; others had embroidered butterflies and dragonflies that looked like a wearable garden. Natural materials like straw were woven with gold into a broderie anglaise. Evoking Alice in Wonderland, the collection also featured floral arrangements that had been woven into the models’ hair and the fabric of the clothes.\nThe trapeze lines — first introduced at Dior in 1958 by then-designer Yves Saint Laurent, who sought to make women look sexy without having to accentuate a slim waistline — also made a return. Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri shared that her inspiration was “the transition between childhood and adulthood and how this moment is represented in a transformation of what we wear.”\nAt Schiaparelli, designer Daniel Roseberry offered a contrasting idea of womanhood as he presented looks with extremely cinched waistlines. A dramatic corseted nude gown with Chinoiserie embroidery, worn by Kendall Jenner, showcased an accentuated hourglass shape. Alex Consani, who last year became the first transgender Model of the Year, wore a floor-skimming feathered coat.\nFor Roseberry, the collection was a nod to the past, as he took influence from haute couture pioneer Charles Frederick Worth. The goal, as stated in his show notes, was to “create something that feels new because it’s old” – encapsulating fashion’s ongoing love for archival pieces and the rise of vintage as a luxury status symbol."
